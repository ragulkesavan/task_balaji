"I have met President Kalam four times. In those times I have come to understand why he is so highly revered. Here are some of my experiences.

April 2001: The first of the meetings came in when we he was with DRDO and visited our college for inspecting some of the student projects. Our college had a deep relationship with DRDO - India's defense research organization and he wanted to appraise himself of some of the new developments.

The night before he was supposed to come, at around 10pm he just came over in his jeep with no security and thrilled the students doing the decoration & settings for the following day's event. People were stunned to see an eminent guy with a massive security threat just walking like that and asking people what they were working on. He said he wanted to meet the real hardworking people who were relegated to the back on the event day.

There was a big commotion in the hostel that night as everybody ran to grab some paper or the other to get his autograph. Then on the event day, he patiently listened to all our ideas, even though many of our ideas were too impractical if I think about it now. He acted as though he was our buddy, and not the highest ranking scientist in India.

February 2003: By this time, Kalam had already become India's President. I was in IIT Delhi for a student event. A couple of months before that, I got an award from the Institution of Engineers on a defense related idea and wanted to tell our President that. So, I walked up to Rashtrapathi Bhavan (President's Office) and wrote a poorly written handnote in the front desk saying I want to meet the President for some of the ideas I was working on how to develop India. They thought it was weird and said they will send the note to his secretary. You don't just walk to meet the President of 1.2 billion people. It was crazy, but I was just a stupid teenager who had a more simplistic view of the world.

Actually,it was my grandfather who moulded me a lot who gave this idea of directly writing to the President. He had a keen sense of people and thought the President Kalam might read it.

The next day evening as I came back from my competition, my uncle with whom I stayed in Delhi looked very excited. He said the President's office called and they asked if I was free the following day. Free? I would run in the middle of a highway to meet the President of India, revered by a billion people. That was the most positive shocking news I had ever heard. The President wanted to meet some random teenager in response to a poorly handwritten note. My uncle told me not to get my hopes too much and maybe someone in President's office wanted to meet me. But, if I ever get a chance to meet his excellency, I should try to take a photograph with him.

The next day, I took an autorickshaw to the rashtrapathi bhavan and still didn't know that I will meet the President. I got out of the Autorickshaw and told the guard that I was here to meet the President. Looking at me and the autorickshaw he was barely able to contain a laughter. He then called up the office to confirm and let me walk.

After 30 minutes of security checks, I was outside his office. Then couple of his assistants came and trained me on how to act when I'm with the President. They told me how to eat, how to respond, etc. My heart started to pant. I was totally unprepared as I didn't expect to meet him. I didn't even have a good set of formal shirts for that event. I looked totally out of place and didn't have anyone to ask my silly questions on how to behave. I was alone and afraid. As a teenager, life didn't prepare me for that day.

Then the moment came. I was asked to enter the President's Office. I expected to see a huge coterie of assistants and a few security guys. Stunned to see that there was none. The President was alone in his desk working. I closed the door and stood. The President offered me a seat and asked me to explain my ideas.

In the next 30 minutes, I talked about all the various science papers I had written and the President not just put up with that, but kept making notes & comments on my papers. It was like a dream and was tempted to pinch myself to realize what was happening. Within a few minutes he drilled into the ideas and went into the minute details of the papers, while still keeping the talk jovial. He even joked about how the President was forced to wear these formals, while he would have preferred to wear the folded fullsleeve shirts. At the end of 30 minutes, his secretary came in and said it was time for his next appointment.

So, I stood up, thanked him and went out. Oops, I forgot to take a photograph with him. I then gently asked his secretary, if I can take a photograph with him. The secretary replied that it is not a custom to take a Photograph with visitors in that office and President was to be there at an another event in 1 hour. The President heard that and called for his photographer. I was clumsily dressed and looked awkwardly and entered his office once again. (Give that he is never late for any appointments that 5 extra minutes probably took away his rest time before he went on to meet business leaders at FICCI.)

After I came out, his secretary asked about the next time I will be in Delhi. I told him that I will be around for independence day (August 15). He just made a note of it and left. This is the greatest day of my little life. I got to chat with my hero for more than half hour. 
----
August 12, 2003: I was in Delhi again at my uncle's place. Once again, the President's office called. I was even more shocked this time, as I didn't even write a stupid note this time. I was called once again to meet, remembering the previous conversation. It seems the President wanted to meet a couple of teenagers on the eve of our Independence day. This time it was a shorter meeting at 15 minutes and the President once again put up with my impractical ideas on how to change the nation. 
----

Later, I had seen him a couple of times at Microsoft in 2008 after his Presidential term. He was there for an event and although I didn't get a chance to meet him one on one, it was great to see His Excellency. In one of the events - a dinner hosted by Bill Gates Sr (father of Microsoft founder), Gates Sr remarked that we should call Kalam always a President (in the US, once a President always a President). I agree.
---
A lot of people claim down to earth, but our President was in a different level. He had a an extraordinary memory, patience, attention to details and more importantly kindness. While at office, he had almost turned the massive President's office into a science & social lab, inviting ideas from all over the nation. He was in in his 70s and was past his peak. Even then his mind was relentlessly working on science & language. He seemed to do his work by himself and inspired others to do the same.

He was a quintessential Gandhi in a scientist robe and the greatest President we had ever had. In a nation where politicians act like pigs looking for the next avenue to rob, he was sitting there building bridges with common people, doing research, writing books and talking science. Our nation was gifted to have him."
"The vegetables grown on the field doesn’t end up magically in your plate. It requires a lot of moving around across the country and quality control to throw out a lot of produce. This happens through India’s weakest skillset — logistics & supply chain.

Let’s say an onion farmer got 12,000 kgs of produce to the Mandasur mandi in Madhya Pradesh. He sells at Rs 3/kg to a trader there. The trader then hires a truck to take it to a major market like Delhi. Just fuel (about 200 liters of Diesel to make the 1000 km), depreciation, labour costs (one week pay to driver and cleaner) and toll alone would cost the truck about Rs. 30,000 to get to New Delhi. The truck owner adds his margins & for maintenance and the total cost of the trip turns out to be about Rs. 40000. You would be somewhat lucky to find a trucker who would move 12000 kg over 1000km for this amount.

The trader has spent about 36k to the farmer (12k*Rs.3/kg) and about Rs. 40k to the trucker and after the 5 day truck journey would be lucky to have 10,000 kgs of onions making it to Delhi [with the rest 1/6 rotten, stolen, fallen etc] for 76,000 rupees or about Rs. 7.6/kg. Add his margins, cost of capital and coordination cost and he would have to sell at a minimum of Rs. 9/kg at a wholesale market in Delhi.

Now, a pushcart retailer buys 50kg from the wholesaler, carry the whole thing to your street. The purchasers on the street are going to be far more picky than the mandi buyer. The retailer would be lucky to sell 40kg of produce by end of the day (with the rest thrown out). Assuming he bought Rs 450 (9*50) worth of onions in the morning and needs to make a minimum of Rs. 250 at the end of day after giving Rs. 100 bribe to local policemen/goons, he would have to sell the 40 kg onions at Rs. 20/kg (450+250+100 = 800).

Maybe instead of a pushcart, the retailer might be a grocery store owner. He could sell more vegetables, but he also has to pay for real estate, employees, billing systems and the owner is not going to be content with just Rs. 250/day.

This is how a Rs. 3/kg onion becomes Rs. 20 when you buy. It is not like there are crorepathis inbetween. And we are talking about a very simple supply chain with just 1 trader, 1 trucker and 1 retailer, with the vegetable moving just 1000km.

A lot of times the farmer would be growing quite far from the mandi and would need someone to move the produce to mandi. That is a few more rupees per kg. Often times they might be harvesting only a few hundred kgs [most farm holdings are small] and there might be aggregators in the middle as the major buyers will not be able to buy that small. They need their commission as well.

And sometimes the produce could move far more across the country — say apples from Himachal to Kerala, with a lot of handling inbetween [drastically increasing fuel & transportation costs] and a lot of wastage. And many times you might not be immediately consuming the stuff and the produce might need to be stored in a warehouse or cold storage for weeks. Sometimes there might be natural disasters, strikes, hartals etc and the entire truck load could be wasted.

The final result might be far more than Rs. 20/kg you might be paying for a produce that was sold by the farmer for Rs. 3.

Developed countries with better supply chains, cheaper transport systems [moving stuff over water costs a fraction of roads], cheaper credit, bigger scale and better storage infrastructure handle this a little better. But, even there the spread between retail costs and production costs is huge.

Sure, the farmer could directly sell to the buyer, but that is not going to remove the cost of moving the produce or the wastage. And the farmer is spending time doing a complex thing [selling products] that is not his core forte [of growing things]. He might not know in which street what customer is likely to buy a big chunk of carrots today. Imagine you are a software developer and suddenly asked to sell your software besides just coding. Will the transition be easy? And even with the right skills might not have the scale to do the stuff — the farms are too small and too far from the cities. And finally he needs to be able to manage the capital — selling to the consumer might happen a lot of time after producing the stuff — and our financial system is not the greatest in lending money.

What are some “partial” solutions that people said in comments?

“Remove the middle man”: People say sell the product through e-commerce sites like Amazon — aka sell it through the world’s richest middleman. The economics is even worse there. What do you think the cost of moving 1 kg of perishable good across the country? Have you tried sending a parcel/courier from one part of the country to another? What was the cost?
“Let the postal department handle it”: India Post takes 5–10 rupees to move a few grams of standardised mail. And it is still loss making. How much do you think they will charge to move a kilo of unevenly packed vegetable across the country? Your onion bag will cost Rs 100 when it comes over mail.
“Let the government do it”: Indians have a split personality. On one side they think the government is the worst ever and on another side they think the government is made of Avengers who have a solution to every problem. They could not even handle airlines and telephony and good luck having them run something as complicated as vegetable supply chain.
I don’t think any of them are solutions. Here are a few other that seem more viable:

Let the government enable farmers to enter into long term contracts: A big issue is that farmers don’t know the value of the produce before they sow. What if they could sell their product ahead of time to buyers — removing price uncertainty on both sides.
Give better data on what to plant. Indian farmers often play the slot machine. They sometimes see high prices and grow that vegetable, only to realise everyone is growing that and ends up in a bumper harvest. The government can collect data on what is being sown and give warning ahead of time on what the production and prices might be.
Build inland and ocean waterways and move the country’s population along the water ways (rivers and ocean). Shipping over water is a fraction of road shipping cost.
Process more foods. There might be times when the price is too low or transportation costs too high. In those times the foods might have to get processed (say into jams, juices, canned vegetables) to avoid wastage.
Enable free market. Do away with the APMC act that limits farmer’s ability to sell it on free markets. Current system enables cartels to skew the market.
While the middleman are a problem, there is often too much blame assigned to them. Think of it this way. If you think the vegetable retailers, logistics and wholesalers are making a lot of money, why don’t you build your children’s career in that? Why don’t you start your startups in that? Why don’t India’s rich people put money in that? There have been a lot of startups in this space and none successful. It is because it is HARD and not really profitable. If you don’t understand the value of logistics you can neither win wars nor businesses."
"In terms of sheer hardware specs, there is no comparison. Honda Asimo was miles ahead of ours. There are areas we beat them — such as indoor positioning and navigation, along with battery life, but overall there is no comparison in hardware specs of a product that cost 50x more than ours.

You would not benchmark your automobile with an uber cool car like ThrustSSC that can run 1220 km/hr or Sunswift eVe that can fully run on Solar. Same works here.

Honda Asimo was primarily a tech demonstration project. It was to show that Honda can build advanced technology. It was never built to commercially sell those robots. If you had billions of dollars for R&D, decades of time and don’t have to concern yourself with practical day to day concerns (such as battery life), it is possible to produce amazing technology.

Here is a small example of what complex engineering we have to do:

The robot moves almost noiselessly and that required a lot of R&D from us. You might not mind the motor noise with Atlas or Asimo, but if you had to put through a robot every day in your office, you will complain of the noise. Again, we have to deal with children trying to get in the way and even jumping on top of it.

Apart from real engineering problems, we have to solve for social problems including facilities employees deliberately switching it off or not charging, people stealing the chargers, breaking its accessories etc.

Even with Honda’s massive financial backing the Asimo project was unsustainable and Honda has retired the project in favour of more practical (but less impressive to look at) robots. Honda retires its famed Asimo robot

This is the real big problem with robotics industry. While the headlines are grabbed the likes of Boston Dynamics and Honda Asimo, the real issue lies in economic sustainability of the resulting technology. Boston Dynamics, like the Asimo, didn’t lead to any real revenues. It's no wonder Google sold Boston Dynamics to SoftBank

If you were running a car company, your challenge would not be to build the world’s fastest or biggest or smallest or even the most durable/mileage giving car, but a car that will get bought by users and that will pay for your R&D.

That is the focus that the robotics industry needs.

While we would love to look at Asimo and Atlas, ultimately those are like the Ferraris of F1 racing. We are looking to build a Ford Model T or Toyota Corolla - something that will be put everywhere and can satisfy day to day needs.

We are looking to solve the problem of how to get robots solve some of the practical problems that customers would pay for. What can Invento’s new robots do? The problem statements are different.

Given the fact that we are a bootstrapped company, we have no luxury to spend hundreds of millions or decades of effort like the creators of Asimo, Atlas or Sophia. We build robots that you can deploy today, integrate with IT & sales systems and make profits doing that.

These cannot do things like walking up the stairs. These are built for having conversation, collecting visual intelligence, do smooth indoor navigation and help marketing teams get real time data from their showrooms."
"The question has a lot of false assumptions. Money and wealth can both be created and destroyed.

Currently how much currency do you have in your pocket? Is that your total worth? Not really. You might have an education and job, that is worth wealth. In fact, banks might be willing to loan you money because they think the education and employment is of value. You might have good health that is of value. Shane Warne once insured his finger. And you might own a home and is of a huge value. Currency is a small fraction of global wealth.

I run a startup. If I could crack a couple of big challenges in Robotics and can find more customers, the value of my startup and my wealth would go up substantially. If there were a lawsuit or an open source project that replicates our algorithms, my wealth would go down.

If you were a body builder and found that you have a muscular disease that might waste away your muscles in the next few months, your sponsors would vanish. Even if your muscles today look fine.

Most of world’s wealth is locked in our expectation of future benefits. Investors invest in Ola not because it is profitable today. That is how world’s assets are. If our predictions for the future change and so would the value of the assets.

If the land you own on is going to be used by the government to build a major city, you will become a rich person. If on the other hand you find that there is a toxic waste dump coming nearby that value of land will go down and no one would still buy it. You will become poor.

Wealth is created and destroyed based on the future predictions and expectations."
"Not even close.

He has 25 ODI centuries [compared with Tendulkar’s 49 and Kohli 38*]. In averages Kohli (also a middle order batsman) is near 60, nearly 6 above ABD. Of the 25 centuries, 5 are against West Indies [in their worst times], 3 against Zimbabwe etc. Against the best bowling side of his time — Australia — he scored one century and that too at an insipid contest in Zimbabwe. In contrast Sachin has 9 centuries and Kohli has 5 against Australia and a few more against other good bowling sides. Of course he didn’t have to face his own side’s bowling and he scored 2 centuries against England and 1 against New Zealand. Nevermind, none of those 25 centuries resulted in any big trophy win for South Africa.

Even in terms of being a flat track bully he is nowhere close to Rohit Sharma. Rohit has 3 double centuries and the best ABD could get was 176 against Bangladesh.

In Tests it is even worse. There are 30 batsmen with more centuries than ABD. His test centuries equal Mohammad Azharuddin, who played in a very different era, had his career cut short and Azhar was not even the best batsman of his country at that time.

While 6 of the 22 came against Australia [one positive aspect about his Test cricket], 6 also came against West Indies. His average is pretty much average, dozens of people have score more runs than him and he has just 2 double centuries. While one double century brought an extraordinary victory [against India in Ahmedabad] that is the only century he has ever had in India. He has two in Australia [both in Perth], one in England, none in New Zealand or Sri Lanka. Not an example of a very versatile batsman who can play different conditions.

Sure he has had some memorable saves in test cricket, but any decent cricketer who has played that long would have those memorable times. VVS Laxman and Gambhir have had some famous saves, but no one call them the best of all time. Leave alone Laxman’s 281, there was a time when Gambhir and Laxman played for over 2 days when India was following on, until the opposition gave up. These are the innings that keep a player in a top team for a decade, but not sufficient to take them to all time great. This is why none of those respectable lists have ABD among the all time greats.

Sehwag went past the 290 mark thrice in tests and he is not the all time best either. Sourav Ganguly started his career with a couple of test hundreds in English conditions and no one considers him the best test player either. In short, having a couple of good innings doesn’t make a great test player.

No centuries in T20 internationals either and not really set that stage on fire. Not only had he not brought any trophies for South Africa, he has not had much success with his IPL franchises either.

Regarding bowling, even an occasional bowler like Sachin has 200 international wickets compared to ABD’s 9 wickets. And wicketkeeping or catching records ABD doesn’t come at the top either.

Leave alone the run quantum or classic shots, even in aggression he would fall short of McCullum in T20s, Gilchrist/Sehwag in tests and Russell in ODIs. There are 20+ players with better strike rate in ODIs including Afridi and Sehwag.

ABD’s records won’t put him in top 10 in batting or keeping, leave alone his ability to bring significant victories to the teams he played. He is an acrobatic cricketer with the ability to play weird shorts. That’s all."
"Here are the impact of each state results:

Chattisgarh: Congress had an unexpectedly good victory and this will give them confidence. BJP will do a lot of research on what went wrong in that state.

Rajasthan: The state unit stopped listening to both the centre and RSS. Thus, its loss might actually be a good thing for BJP in 2019. There will be leadership changes and also changes on the ground level. Congress would have to watch out for clashes between Gehlot and Pilot.

Madhya Pradesh: Congress and BJP tied in this state. BJP would especially look at NOTA and has to calibrate how to get the middle class back. Without NOTA, it would have been a BJP’s victory and that realisation would be important for it in 2019. Congress would have to watch out for rifts between the young and old generation.

Telangana: The big defeat of Congress-TDP combine would point further questions on CBN’s ability to keep political relevance beyond his own state and whether Congress would want him as an ally, instead of the more powerful TRS. Given a biparty system that we are heading to, if TRS is not in Congress side, that puts them in BJP’s side and that is a good thing for them."
"The best way to kickstart a startup ecosystem is by government spending heavily on future technologies for defense & space. That is how San Francisco got the Silicon Valley and that is how Bangalore became India’s startup hub.

Government has to spend more on ISRO, HAL, DRDO etc and mandate that this extra portion of the allocation should be used by those organisations to purchase relevant technology from startups. Maybe ISRO could buy something from Team Indus or another space related startup. If they miss buying, they lose that money for that year.

Maybe some of that money could get wasted. But, overall it will greatly incentivise both native and non-resident Indians to build ambitious companies and get direct contracts from the government.

When 100s of millions of dollars become mandated every year to be spent on buying technologies from new startups, a host of new startups will get into core technologies with the backing that the government will buy their technology. When core companies come up, so will core engineers who otherwise waste life working for some random consultancy.

Right now government has a plan to give some grants in this regard, but it is so laughably low that no serious startup would try for it.

The heart of any startup ecosystem is core engineering. When that is strengthened all the extra layers will come up on them."
"Indian school history textbooks covers more of the exceptions than the normal.

The narrative taught in Indian schools is that there was the Indus Valley Civilisation — that was just around Indus & definitely non-Hindu yadda yadda yadda then centuries later the Buddhist Mahajanapadas, followed by a king who became a Buddhist because he got averse to war yadda yadda yadda Islamic occupation, British rule freedom fighting to present.

As Jerry Seinfeld would say — “you yadda yadda yadded over the best part”.

The first of Muslim conquests came during the caliphate time and these were strongly repulsed by Indian warriors like the Pulakesi. Umayyad campaigns in India. These Arab defeats arrested the eastward spread of Islam.

Islam extended in Europe, Africa, but it ended in Atlantic in the west and the Indus river in the east. Only the Sindh region was under their rule and not surprisingly the key momentum for the creation of Pakistan came from there.

Then 300 years later came the Mahmud of Ghazni. He raided and plundered a lot of temples in India, but his rule didn’t really extend into the modern day India.

Then more than a century later came the Muhammad of Ghor and this time he was facing an India that didn’t have strong empires. He was able to win the local ruler called Prithviraj Chauhan at the Battles of Tarain. This setup the Delhi sultanates — but most of the time their control didn’t extend beyond Delhi & parts of north.

After consolidating in Delhi, they pushed southward and plundered cities like Warangal (they captured Kohinoor and other most valuable jewellery from Warangal itself), Madurai and Belur in the 13th century.

The reaction to this was the Vijayanagara Empire that pushed back Islamic rule from a lot of south India. They were the first empires of India in using gunpowder and their use of technology was instrumental in their rise. However, infighting later cost their downfall. The Nayak dynasty that took over extended the rule all the way to Sri Lanka — Nayaks of Kandy. In the north too there was a fight back and this is the era of famous forts such as the Chittor fort below.

The peak of the fight back in the north reached with Hemuchandra Vikaramaditya who pushed back the nascent Mughal rule until a stray arrow hit him at the Second Battle of Panipat leading to a disarry of his troops and the rise of the Mughal empire.

Unlike their predecessors, the Mughal empire starting with Akbar with a bit more tolerant of Hindus and the religious conversions were low. This lulled the fight back for a century.

As Akbar’s great-grandson Aurangzeb renewed fight on Hindus, there resumed the Hindu fight back. In the middle of 1600s Shivaji pioneered guerrilla warfare and won a lot of territories. He got crowned as an emperor in 1674. The Maratha empire he founded took over the remnants of the Mughal empire in the early 1700s.

They were on track to build a lasting pan-Indian empire, until their lack of coordination and fighting in too many fronts cost them a defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. Their power dwindled after that paving the way for the British rule.

The massacre of Sikhs and Hindus at the Sikh holocaust of 1762 led to the rise of another fightback in the north under the Ranjit Singh. Ranjit Singh pushed the Iranians and Afghans westward and established a key kingdom in the north. There was another Sikh-Hindu renaissance as he built a number of Gurudwaras and helped restore a lot of Hindu temples such as the Kashi Vishwanath temple.

Ranjit Singh also recaptured India’s famous diamond — Koh-i-Noor — and willed to the Puri Jagannath temple. However, the East India Company hoodwinked him and the will never got executed, with the diamond going to London forever.

The East India Company that took power from Marathas, Sikhs and others survived for a few decades by making friendly alliances with a lot of Indian kings. However, as they grew autocratic the Indian kings fought back. The East India Company rule could not even last a century from their first major victory in 1760s — and were pushed out of existence in Indian Rebellion of 1857.

The British crown took over from the company was initially friendly to the Indians. They built Universities across India and also focused a bit on growth. They also enabled Indians to organise themselves through the Indian National Congress and other groupings.

However, as their rule became more autocratic with Rowlatt act and Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Indians once again fought back. This time the Indian National Congress that was formed to build cordial relations between the Indians and the British, became the tool to push the British out. In less than 3 decades from the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, the British were out of India.

The British crown rule didn’t last even as long as the company. Just 89 years.

That is the short story of India. It is a story of fight back. Look at the some of the world’s largest empires ending in the borders of India.

It is a story of fight back. Of Chanakya and Chandragupta fighting back the Greeks. Of Skandagupta and Yasodharman fighting back Huna invasions. Of Pulakesi and Saindhava who defeated the Arabs. Of the Harihara who fought back the Sultanates. Of Hemu and Shivaji who fought back the Mughals. Of Ranjit Singh, Tipu Sultan and countless others in fighting back the East India Company. And of Gandhi, Patel, Nehru fighting back the British crown.

In parallel to the rulers, there were religious saints such as the Adi Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhwacharya, Tulsidas, Vivekananda who helped bring a Hindu renaissance.

Adi Shankara had the vision to establish the 4 (or 5) key centers strategically placed across the lengths and breadths of India.

Anytime an outsider was reasonable and respectful, we worked with them. When an outsider like Kanishka or Akbar respected our traditions, we helped them build lasting legacy. When they destroyed our culture like the Muhammads of Ghor, Ghazni, Timur, Aurangzeb, we fought back. We rebuilt every major temple they destroyed.

This story of our fight back is how our religion and culture survived for so long. While we have to study the religion of other Bronze and Iron age cultures from Egypt to Uruq to Persia to Rome and Greece — in museums, ours lives and thrives.

Because, we relentlessly fight back."
"Yes. Delhi is choking. It is the world’s most polluted capital and it is truly hazardous at this point — AQI touches ‘HAZARDOUS’ category; outdoors turn toxic for humans.

Population explosion has turned a beautiful city into a monster. And it is a poor advertisement for India as a whole as diplomats, businessmen and foreign politicians arrive in Delhi before they see other parts of India.

More importantly, the effectiveness of our bureaucrats and law makers will be low if they have to put through with a smoke chimney — and their poor health will lower the effectiveness of the central government.

Among the dozens of things we could do to fight pollution, we have to take the government off Delhi and reduce some of the stress. Move it anywhere else - with a much cleaner air. There are plenty of good candidate locations across India — with much cleaner air, water and transportation access. That would allow our government to be more productive and the foreign visitors to appreciate an India that is not all haze.

As the government exits Delhi, its population and vehicular traffic will go down and provide sufficient time to cleanup the city.

Unless we take a drastic measure, the city and the governments therein face a massive calamity due to the pollution.

My top choices would be in India’s center:

Near Paradip in Odisha. Access to ports, fresh water and room for expansion. It has the basic infra necessary for a capital. Only concern is its ongoing industrialisation might bring in pollution.
Near Bhedaghat in MP. Close to Narmada and serene environs of Mahadev hills. Plenty of history around. Jabalpur airport can be made into an international airport and other basic infra can be built.

If we plan for eco-friendly capital and a strong focus on nature friendliness and cleanliness from day 1, it could set the blueprint for a new India."
"If Jack Dorsey had held a poster on “Smash Jewish Patriarchy” or “Stop Christian patriarchy” or “Stop Parsi patriarchy” there would have been far more controversy.

Because you don’t denigrate a particular ethnic, social or people. That is not acceptable even for normal people — leave alone a major requirement for someone who has a big finger on controlling world’s news.

Attacking Brahmins is not any more bigoted than attacking any other ethnic, social or religious grouping.

It is fine to fight patriarchy, casteism etc. But, scapegoating a community is not fine.

Multiple groups in India are quick to find easy scapegoats for large social problems. A minority like Brahmins who make up less than 5% of the population is an easy target.

The fact is that Indian caste system is far more complicated than anything Brahmins built. You don’t need anyone to tell an Indian how to discriminate against another.

For instance, Tamil Nadu has gruesome murders on caste — when people marry outside their caste or try to enter some religious areas. However, historically for Tamil Brahmins the caste is black and white — themselves on one group and “non-Brahmins” on another pile. The rivals killing each other are not Brahmins nor were considered high caste by Brahmins. In short, that caste violence between Dalits and non-Dalits has nothing to do with Brahmins.

In some other parts of India, Brahmins do play a role in caste violence, but there are much bigger, powerful castes who have a bigger hand.

Casteism exists for real in India. There is no denying about it. But, scapegoating one minority group for all the casteism issues is ludicrous. Humans require no religious book to start discriminating among themselves and most people outside Brahmin community had little access to Brahmins religious books.

Rather than this pointless blamegaming, leaders should look at solving some of the core problems that come from development disparities.

Across the world, people have had caste systems and they were broken through indirect means:

Urbanisation — the anonymity of cities can help people break out of past tags [of course, it by itself cannot solve every problem]
Rule of law — make sure the reach of police reaches every corner of India and any crime [casteist or otherwise] get quickly fought. A lot of times the crimes happened publicly without anyone stopping it.
Push on growth — a family that is intent on growing wealth and climbing up the ladder will have little energy to spend on discrimination
Social mobility — make sure the public funded education, safety, healthcare reaches everyone and helps them move up in life."
"No, I didn’t get to the ICPC world finals. When I was in my 5th sem (Junior year) I led a team to Asia regionals in Dhaka. We did a lot of preparations individually, but we failed to do the problems in efficient divide & conquer methods.

In the Asia regionals, the team we faced was the top from NUS and they collaborated like crazy. While we would discuss each problem as a team and try to solve in a very inefficient way, those guys would rip the problem apart in minutes, divide and conquer and get the results.

My memory is a bit hazy, but I believe we got 2 out of 6 problems correct and a got a partial score on the 3rd one. The top teams got 4 of the 6 problems correct. We could not make into top 2 and had to settle for a “Honorable Mention”. It was heartbreaking for me, but those guys were more deserving.

We did have a good trip to Bangladesh though. We were treated great and had a great adventure going from Madurai to Dhaka through multiple transportation — trains, buses, ferries etc.

I should have used the experience to have a crack at ACM in my senior year, but I was busy in a research project and never again got into competitive programming. One of the many regrets in life ;-)"
"I hate such regionalistic politics. In Tamil Nadu people used to say “north is growing, south is falling”. Things cannot be farther from the truth.

When the Constitution was written, more than half of the members of the drafting committee — BN Rau, TT Krishnamachari, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Gopalswami Ayyangar, Madhava Rao — were from the south. One example among many of how the south was given its due importance.

India’s first Army Chief of Staff and Field Marshall was FM Cariappa from Karnataka. In fact, of the first 4 Indians to lead the army, 3 of them are from Karnataka — Cariappa, Shriganesh, and Thimmaya. 3 of the 26 generals in total — Kumaramangalam, Sundarji, Padmanaban — are from Tamil Nadu. Of the last 7 RBI governors, 5 are from the south including 2 from Andhra Pradesh. Last 4 ISRO chairmen are all from the south, including 3 from Kerala.

When independent India built its top education institutes, Madras got among the first of IITs, Warangal got the first of RECs (now NIT) and Bangalore got among the earliest of IIMs. UP, Bihar, MP and other northern states got these much later.

Where is the question of step-motherly treatment towards the south? While the north Indians did have more political power, the south did get its due share in the economic development, education, and infrastructure.

Many of the northern states didn’t get proper infrastructure, universities or economic development during the British Raj or in independent India. Thus, there might be more funds to those regions that are weak. Some of the poorer states might get more funds to develop themselves than the richer states. That is how India as a whole can be a developed nation.

Some of us south Indians have the attitude that when we grew it was our own effort and when we are not growing as fast as some of the northern states now, it is someone else’s fault. We forget the policies like “freight equalisation” that disproportionately benefited us in the past and we forget the investments that helped us to get to the state we are in. Should we not have a similiar ladder for the eastern and central states?"
"Congress is unlikely to do so. The party is firmly organised around one family and it doesn’t have space to talk about even its own legends, leave alone trying to own a person from some other party.

BJP doesn’t have a single core and can change its heroes from time to time [Vajpayee->Advani->Modi] and is also organised in a way to flexibly take ownership of leaders from outside its umbrella.

For Congress to do so, it has to get back to democracy and that is a huge risk to the family business."
"I like the US model of building capital cities from scratch, rather than taking over existing cities. This helps you build a lot of extra cities, generating employment and economic activity.

I would have the Tamil Nadu capital somewhere in the center that will enable people from every part of the state access quickly. Right now, it is at a corner putting pressure on people from down south.

And it has to be a city with a lot of access to freshwater given that its population will likely growth. And it has to be in a region with a lot of history, to provide people the continuity.

I would choose a small town like Musiri."
"I have no connection to this town beyond just driving through it on occassion.

It is at the geographic center of TN and on the banks of river Kaveri. The region has a huge chola history and heritage. And some distance [hopefully the new city doesn’t reach that far] from there there are plenty of nice forests for the population to enjoy nature with respect. It is not really close to any established political party/power and is in more of a neutral territory.

Once the government moves its offices and all the peripherals out of Chennai, the metro gets decongested and a bit depoliticised. We could move a few millions to this new capital city and in its outskirts would be famed institutions like the NIT Trichy and IIM.

This way we will have a new city in addition to Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy, Tirunelveli, Salem and Vellore. It improves TN’s economy, spreads development in the interior parts and also makes Chennai more liveable/less expensive."
"Modi had an early start in politics [was inculcated in RSS by age 8] and mentored by influential people. Another big advantage he had was in doing theater acting in school that usually sets the ground for politics. This is by getting out stage fear as well as being able to snappily communicate to the audience at an instant.

He was volunteering for RSS for more than 15 years, when got a chance at leadership during the Emergency in mid 1970s. Made a name during that time and 10 years later was quite instrumental in helping BJP win local elections in Gujarat around the time Ramayan series on TV was to get launched.

Over the next 15 years he helped Advani and BJP grow the party from near nothing to a key national player. The experience managing campaign for others was a huge thing and was known as a key rising star within the BJP.

Then in late 2001, he got a huge opening. Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel was mismanaging the state during the Bhuj earthquake. Citing ill health, BJP leadership replaced him and brought Modi as a stopgap leader to take through the elections to follow in the next few months.

It is in that interim period the Godhra train burning and the communal riots happened. Modi had no administrative experience until then and it was a huge lesson.

Over the next 12 years, he learned out of that bad experience and helped Gujarat become a darling for global investors.

By the time he stook in 2014, he had already spent over 50 years volunteering for the RSS and had spent over 40 years building the politics of BJP. Given his early start and focus on Yoga, he was quite healthy & energetic for a 64 year old person. With that experience and energy, along with the knack he developed at the theater, he was able to stand out in a pool of insipid politicians.

He was able to sell hope, vision and energy like nobody else did and sold both the economic prosperity and Hindutva to Indian voters. And did a good job at the office since 2014."
"With all due respect to the dead guy — the guy was likely a total idiot and did a very dangerous thing all in the name of propagating his religion.

American killed on Andaman island home to uncontacted people, body yet to be recovered

The American was identified as 27-year-old John Allen Chau, who sources said was a Christian missionary who wanted to convert the Sentinelese tribe that inhabits the island where he was killed.

Outside contact with the sentinel tribes are prohibited by the Government of India as they are not immune to our germs. We don’t want those tribes to die in the way the Native Americans died after the Europeans went there.

Thus, even though the Indian government manages the island, it never sends anyone to enforce its laws or for any kind of contact.

This guy illegally entered the island to spread his religion like how missionaries did in Africa and the Americas. And got killed in the process. Hopefully, he didn’t spread any epidemic to the poor tribes."
"Current term is almost done and there are only 6 months left. Of which the last few months cannot be the time for any big change due to Election Commission rules. This is the time to make sure the existing policies — including Swachh Bharat — getting toilets everywhere and other mission to get electricity to every home, get UPI/Rupay adopted more broadly can be done.

However, if we are talking of the next term, there are things in plenty: India Dreams Collection: Ideas for changing India.

I want Modiji to take up one core issue every year and put all energies in solving them.

Year 1: Completely get out of adult illiteracy. There are nearly 28 crore illiterates in India. If the government puts a goal to achieve literacy to 25 crore of them in a year at a spending of Rs. 3000/person — it is quite possible to spend 75000 crore rupees and get out of the problem for good. We are talking an amount less than 0.2% of GDP and with huge benefits. Given the ubiquitous availability of the Internet, we can solve illiteracy faster than any other country before.

Given that smartphones cost less than Rs. 2000, government can spend thousands of crores on developing regional language content and get every illiterate person the ability to have a basic command over the language. And the testing could be done over the phone with Aadhar as the auth layer.

This can become the pipe for all future education, awareness and bring in tons of change at ground level.

Year 2: Make a target to get every pregnancy at a hospital and reduce Infant Mortality rate to less than 5/1000 live births from over 30 right now. This would require tracking every pregnant woman, provide them sufficient nutrition and use sensors to make sure that the supplements reach them and on time medical assistance reaches to get the infant born in the right way.

Fighting IMR this way would dramatically improve women health, reduce malnutrition and also bring down the birth rates.

Year 3: Make pollution fighting a war cry. Inspire party volunteers and Indians across the country, take up a massive exercise of taking control of our lakes, rivers, canals and most importantly air. Lakhs of crores worth of investment has to be brought into sewage collection, biogas plants for agricultural waste, complete replacement of diesel buses in all major cities with electric buses and fighting every fire everywhere in India with accurate remote sensing.

If some dude anywhere in India sets his bush or waste on fire, the satellite imaging should bring the police home in minutes.

Year 4: Make a national war on unemployment. Have a LinkedIn kind of setup for every Indian citizen that would be Aadhar linked and have a survey of their skills. The Skills India program has to get 100x better funded and pushed through this. Have the program train 100s of millions with newer technologies and place them. Just as how UPI and RuPay are eating into global financial players, we need the employment engine do a range of operations from finding and validating talent to doing background checks etc at full ease.

Year 5: Put a man on moon. Rapid investments in GSLV launch vehicles and decades of expertise in safely putting objects in space, including in Moon and Mars should be utilised for manned missions. This new space race could bring in a lot of new technologies."
"I don’t think Jack Dorsey really understood all the politics and issues underlying before held a bigoted, casteist poster handed to him by some random activist. I’m not sure if we have enough proof to show Twitter as a casteist organisation.

Many westerners who come to India unknowingly see themselves the Messiah and feel a need to take part in social causes they don’t know much about. Sort of a Mother Teresa moment. Think of Bruce Banner healing people in Kolkata slum in the Avengers movie. Yeah, saving people by mere virtue of born in a particular colour. With that power why not solve homelessness issue in SF bay area?

You won’t find many Indian or Chinese CEOs walking into America and holding rallies about inner city development, overflowing prisons, dropping life expectancy, opioid crisis, gerrymandering, exploding healthcare costs,gun control or the war on drugs. Those are problems, but we cannot solve those from outside. However, American leaders who cannot fix many of social issues at home become experts at solving social issues of other countries they might have never even visited — leave alone know.

In short, Jack Dorsey seems to have been foolishly carried away by the same urges that inflicted thousands of other westerners who set foot in India. I don’t think his actions reflect deeper problems at Twitter."
"There are multiple things of importance with the GSAT-29 launch.

At 3400+ kgs, It is the heaviest satellite carried by India so far. While ISRO has really mastered the art of sending hundreds of tiny satellites, they still lag behind NASA, SpaceX and Ariane when it comes to sending heavy satellites.

Mastering the heavy payloads is critical to accessing the highly lucrative satellite launch industry and also is critical to send humans to space. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III is going to become the playbook vehicle that will lead the cryogenic engine development in India.

The GSAT-29 satellite itself is critical to provide internet connectivity to remote areas and will be a part of constellation that will provide good bandwidth satellite internet connectivity that can work even in places where the optical fibers cannot reach.

In short:

Preparation for manned missions
Accessing a highly lucrative heavy satellite market
Providing reliable internet connections to remote locations"
"We have been experimenting with a variety of different robot designs at Invento. At least with the Indian customers, there has always been a preference for humanoids.

While we got advice from top Japanese and Chinese entrepreneurs that we should go for non-human designs, in our applications our customers didn’t want those.

Even in our current designs — the ones that are a little more closer to humans are preferred by our customers than the ones that are less anthropomorphic.

Pic one 1 is less human than pic 2, but the 2 is more preferred than 1.
From our experience deploying the robots in over a dozen locations permanently and over 100 locations temporarily, there is a distinct preference for humanoids among the consumers.

In our experience people don’t want to converse with entities that don’t have some shape and form of humans."
"Ms. Sushma Swaraj is an amazing individual. We once got a chance to demo our robot to her and she playfully made it to do namaste. Her curiosity and cheerful personality will surely be missed.

However, BJP under Modi is trying to follow the global pattern of encouraging younger leaders, rather than the previous pattern of “leadership until death”.

There are many great young leaders who need their path to glory. While they might not be a Advani, Swaraj, Vajpayee or Modi now, with time they can become one. For that they need time and exposure. That can come only when the elders give way to the young."
"The cricket would have been more insipid.

I grew up sticking big posters of Sourav around my home. When Sourav scored his 183 at the 1999 World Cup, I was cheering at his hometown of Kolkata. As a schoolkid, for me watching ODI Cricket meant watching the Sachin-Sourav opening partnership and Sourav’s amazing cover drives. When I was in England I made sure to get to the Lords balcony and ceremonially hold the T-shirt — the balcony that is now famous for the Sourav Ganguly taking off his shirt.

While the Sachin-Rahul brand of cricket was like a wholesome thayirsadam (curd rice), Sourav Ganguly was like a Pani Puri — little spicy, little tangy, little sweet. There is always something interesting.

He brought the aggression to the field and built a whole generation of cricketers who can dish out to the opponents, whether in runs & wickets or in colourful expletives. It was the rise of a confident India. The previous generation was too meek in-front of the gora sahibs (white masters).

He took on the unbeatable Australians under Steve Waugh in 2001 and brought a grand success, on the back of VVS Laxman’s all time greatest innings.

While they won great in India, Sourav’s India didn’t mind taking aggressive push out of home. In 2002 at Leeds, India had a remarkable victory and shared the test series honours and won the Natwest ODI series.

Again in Australia in 2003, India won at Adelaide and entered the 3rd test leading 1–0. They fought brilliantly at MCG, but just got under an unbelievable Ponting innings to draw the series level. In the same year, India’s hands at World Cup was spoiled by Ponting in the finals.

Two times it came close to doing history making series victories, just missed. But, in 2004 Pakistan they did make history by winning the series 2–1.

Sourav is an amazing winner. And he had no issues being aggressive in his winning attitude."
"Smart Indians have not failed in India. The father of Indian nuclear program, Homi Bhaba, succeeded in India. The father of Indian space program, Vikram Sarabhai, succeeded in India. In both fields, India is among the world’s top countries. I don’t know of any Indian American who has had an equivalent impact in the US.

The richest Indians — including the Mukesh Ambani, Premji, Shiv Nadar, Kumaramangalam Birla etc are individually richer than richest 10 Indian Americans put together.

The greatest Indian mathematician of modern era [Ramanujan] lived in India. Most of the greatest Indian physicists of modern era [CV Raman, JC Bose, SN Bose, Meghnad Saha] lived in India.

The best of Indian engineers who inspire students to this day — Kalam, Sreedharan, Visvesvaraya — built great things in India.

Some of the biggest/successful Indian founded & led startups are based in places like Bangalore, not in San Francisco.

The best Indian moviemakers such as Satyajit Ray and Manirathnam were/are in India. The best Indian designers are in India. The best Indian musicians are in India.

If they want to be somewhat successful, Indians emigrate to US and Europe. But, if they want to be really successful like Gandhi, Bose, Ambani, Ratan Tata etc, the Indians get back home. India is the path to glory for Indians.

1000s of Indians cutting across fields succeed remarkably in India and easily beat their non-resident counterparts. The system is not impeding them and they go through the same traffic and pollution that the rest do. It is just that do you want to aim for them or content being just above-average?

Being in India is like working at a startup. It is chaotic and without order. It can pull you down. But, is the only real way to climb to the top of the ladder."
"I will interpret robotics to mean hardware physical robots.

There is hardly any appetite for investing in hardware — robots or otherwise. Investors look for “proven” plans, meaning following the blueprints of other successful Indian startups that have traditionally succeeded being the middleman in some industry [Redbus, Flipkart, InMobi, Swiggy…]. The stories of GreyOrange or Ather energy are exceptions.
Talent acquisition in hardware can be problematic. In India, we don’t teach students to be hands-on.
Operations and supply chains are a nightmare. I was quite surprised that it is quite hard to ship a delicate good from Bangalore to Delhi by road.
The support infrastructure for design and prototyping are limited.
All said, there are also many advantages operating in India. Indian customers tend to value tangible products more than the intangible products. And there are many Indian sectors like retail, banking and office infrastructure that are going through a massive change, enabling a lot of disruptive forces."
"Domestic cricket in the form of IPL is more popular than international cricket.
There is a king Kohli in town who can beat Sachin Tendulkar in ODIs. India chases like a tiger under him. He scores centuries even while sleeping.
India won World Cup, champions trophy etc in an era of dominant ODI cricket with Dhoni, Kohli and Rohit.
India was the world no 1 test side in multiple years of the last decade.
If Rohit Sharma is around 200 is the new 100. He scored 3 doubles.
Bowling is not dead. India can play 5 pacers at once and terrorise even the best teams at their home. Some of the bowlers with best averages ever in ODI are playing now — Rashid Khan, Kuldeep Yadav, Mitchell Starc, Jasprit Bumrah. Bowling has become incredibly smart these days with knuckle ball, carrom ball etc."
"UP is densely populated because it is incredibly gifted with water and silt.

Look at this map of India’s northern plains. Especially the yellow region"
"This density of perennial rivers in a tropical environment is highly unusual. Imagine 5 Nile rivers going parallel. That is Uttar Pradesh.

And Ganga and her sisters bring down silt from Himalayas like no other river in the world. Himalayas being a young mountain is easily eroded by these rivers and thus the water is rich in silt.

Given this much water and this much alluvial resource supporting a very prosperous agricultural region, the region has been a key centre of world civilisation for thousands of years.

Previously people thought that advanced civilisation in Ganga is more recent. As we see in recent findings (In Uttar Pradesh, 4,000-Year-Old Chariots And Coffins Found) the civilisation there might be much older.

Since then it has been a key centre of Indian economy and power.

During the British rule this all changed. As the Raj consciously tried to build a power away from India’s traditional centres, new cities like Bombay, Calcutta and Madras became the centre of political power and prosperity.

UP’s key cities fell out of favour and while there was some infrastructure & factories built in places like Allahabad, this was no way enough for a population the size of Russia.

Independent India didn’t do much to UP either. The state is yet to have a major metropolis despite being the largest in population and among the wealthiest historically.

The state began its long descent into poverty and poor governance, its cities crumbled without as many universities and its people without as many good jobs. Crime results from that.

MP doesn’t have as much population and its fall was not as much [it had fallen much earlier when Ujjain stopped being the capital].

Don't suggest edits to change place names. This is the name in British era and understand the context."
"Mahatma Gandhi is called the Father of the Nation* and he was more akin to a Ben Franklin + Thomas Jefferson.

The George Washington equivalent is Jawaharlal Nehru, who led the country as the first Prime Minister and led the country in its key wars.

The Abraham Lincoln equivalent would be Vallabhai Patel, who was quite instrumental in keeping the people united rather than letting them getting split.

The Martin Luther King equivalent would be Ambedkar who was a key social reformer for the downtrodden.

*Although no formal notification by the government has been passed, both the government and public sees him that way."
"At the time of Independence, Indian congress used to be moderately conservative. While it had a lot of liberals, the conservatives outnumbered them. Thus, Jinnah, Ambedkar and other leaders accused Congress of being upper-caste Hindu [just like their successors accuse BJP now].

The INC brought some of the earliest laws on cow slaughter and was also key involved in the restoration of Somnath temple, the controversial putting down of Razakkars during the annexations of Hyderabad. The party that put cow in the constitution was not RSS or BJP. It was the Congress.

If Rajdeep Sardesai, Barkha Dutt were magically transported with an NDTV crew to 1947, they would talk of a “communal” leader carrying the Bhagvad Gita while heading the INC and another key “communal” leader committing “genocide” of Muslims in Hyderabad while taking them over. They would also be complaining of a Hindu India taking over Junagadh, Kashmir etc. Thankfully the present day media was not there then.

Over the years Congress lost the right wing. It started with key ministers of Nehru — Rajaji, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, quitting a party that was increasingly turn left. Rajaji formed Swatantra party, Mukherjee founded Jan Sangh etc. These were the precursors to the present day BJP. In short it is the freedom fighting right wing that goes by most of BJP right now.

In 1947 if you had to think of a legitimate Hindu party, RSS would not even come into mind. Now, RSS/BJP had successfully sold the idea that they stand for all Hinduism, nationalism, capitalism etc. That is because they had a hostile takeover of the INC’s struggling conservative division. This changed the fortunes of the two parties.

Congress now is a moderate left wing party that is struggling to win votes. But, 70 years ago it was on the other side"
"May 11, 1998. India went formally nuclear. A huge moment in Indian history and its rise as a confident world power.
July 24, 1991 when Manmohan overhauled a number of archaic economic policies suffocating the economy. I have never seen so many people interested in budgets and government policies as they were then.
4 July 1999. Indian army recaptures Tiger Hill in the Kargil War. It was a period of a massive patriotic surge.
April 24, 1998 — Sachin Tendulkar plays a remarkable cricket innings that is probably the most remembered match of that generation. Why are Sachin Tendulkar’s Sharjah innings so famous?
Feb 28, 1997 the dream budget that simplified a lot of the tax rules.
I will put them in pictures:"
"Providing respect to elders or those in higher social position is a common part of many cultures. While it is now less common, Sir/Madam used to be quite common in UK. In some southern parts of USA, even children address their fathers with Sir. Germans use Herr in their formal communications, Chinese use Shifu, qiánbèi and Japanese use -san in their communications.

In the US, it is again quite common to call President as Mr. President and Senators/Representatives with their title. Same with Professors, Generals and Doctors. In the past, English used to have a honorific pronoun called ye that is used to address important people. It has now merged with less honorific you in modern English. However, many other languages including Indian ones have their equivalent.

While some Indian students uncomfortable with English tend to over use Sir/Madam and not in the right contexts, the subtle use of honorifics is key as you grow in the ladder in many career paths. That is not specific to India."
"In the mid 2000s, I was running a reasonably popular economics blog and had conversations with some of the top economists — including people who advised Larry Summers, Bloomberg columnists etc. I was in active discussions on Indian economic growth of the time. And the big worry of that time was India overheating — India overheats. That is because it was growing through unsustainable means.

Borrowed growth. Look at the inflation rate from 2005 to 2014. From about 3.77% it went to double digits consistently for that decade before falling back below 5% the past 3 years. The credit growth and government spending on social schemes was substantial. Think of like borrowing from your credit card and doing happy shopping at Amazon. Think would be happy for a while. As the bills became due at some point, that drunken growth ended from around 2011 and growth fell to the ground. Even now the RBI could cut interest rates and raise GDP growth. But, that would only raise inflation — that the previous regime didn’t care as much. State of the global economy. In the first decade of the millenium, the state of the global economy was better than today. Now, major economies are still down and global trade is slowing. No major economy is finding a growth anywhere near India’s. Look at world economic growth in last decade versus now.Real estate bubble: From about 2005–10, Indian cities went through a massive housing bubble and that pushed up the prices of cement, iron and also economy. While the bubble never got fully burst, the massive slowdown in the price of real estate in recent years[good for the affordability] also pulls down the economy a bit.
Low base effect. When you are joining your first job, the salary rise will be near infinite and as years go the growth will naturally slow as you are not in a small base anymore. In 2000s, we had a smaller base than it is now.
If in 2018, we can have near the growth of 2010 [when the massive global quantitative easing & easy money around], with the economy more than double the size, with real estate growth arrested, with inflation near a third and a terrible global economy, it is a miracle"
"I have never owned an iPhone myself, but my wife owns a couple of iPhones. I find the iPhones drab and boring, comparing to my OnePlus, but that is just me.

Back when I used to work at Windows Phone, I used to get a lot of competitor phones, including the iPhone for testing and somehow never got a liking to it. There seems to be no surprise/X factor in the phone in over a decade. Every update seems very incremental.

Until the 7th generation, iPhones used to be ok for their price. They had a decent camera and had a long life, besides being reasonably ahead of the competition in battery life and processing power.

Now, they are super expensive and stopped innovating. The iPhone XS seems way more expensive than the Macbook Air and find that ridiculous. Both are computers and find the Macbook far more useful for my daily applications.

Given the massive price, I have finally convinced my wife to come out of the iPhone and join the OnePlus bandwagon. The 6T provides camera capability that is quite good for daily usage and for special occasions we get someone with DSLR anyway. 99% of us are not going to shoot anywhere near the ones on “Shot on iPhone” commercials. We don’t use as much computing on the phone and when I do, I believe the Android 9 has far more capability in terms of coding and library availability.

Thus, iPhone’s price is no longer justifiable for my family or for many other Indians (Things are going from bad to worse for Apple in India).

I’m an Apple fan and have been using the Macbook for a decade. I also have a couple of iPads. I have owned the iPods since early 2000s and use plenty of Apple tools. Just that iPhone is not one among those.

However, iPhone price seems to be justifiable for many Americans [who seldom pay for the phone in one shot, but do it through a 2 year contract] and Chinese [who are rapidly growing rich and look for status markers from the west].

Even there the Apple fans are ditching the iPhone and price seems to be a critical factor. Poor iPhone Sales Expected As Suppliers Fight Apple's Serious Cuts"
"Cheesecake factory.

I didn’t eat out as much, but when I did it usually was Cheesecake factory. My wife and I spent dozens of times in one of those restaurants. We even joked that we should take a franchise to take the restaurant to India. The quality of Cheesecake available in India is much worse than the quality of dosa-sambar available in the US.

In general, food is something I miss a bit. When I didn’t eat at a quality Italian, Thai or Mexican restaurant, I did a little bit of cooking. However, getting quality Asparagus, Broccoli, Zucchini, Brussels Sprouts are all incredibly hard in India. Given the lack of all my favorite vegetables, eating has become a bit boring. I compensate part of it with street food when I travel around India, but you can have only so much street food.

While the vegetable department is boring in India, the availability of amazing mangoes, tender palm fruit, coconut water, jackfruit etc compensate for it.

Friends and Family.

Most of my cousins and classmates are in the US. Back in the states, we used to have periodic cousin get together. I don’t get as many options moving back to India. Same with classmates and friends. I have only one cousin and one classmate in Bengaluru.

Thus, when I was in SF this May, a lot of my time was spent meeting my friends and family. It was back to business once I got to Bangalore.

Driving to the national parks.

I have driven through 47 states [including Alaska] and have done coast to coast 6 times. I have lived in 6 states and been to most national parks.

In India, I don’t drive as much as I used to in the states. While Karnataka provides a lot of getaway options, still the majestic Yellowstone, Glacier or Grand Canyon is missed.

Again these are minor irritants. Whenever I travel to US on business trips, I get to do some of the above, besides shopping at Kohls — the only place I ever shop for clothes.

On the whole, I enjoy India and moving back was a great decision. Just that the three things I miss — food, family and wildlife — are the ones many Indians miss while in the US."
"North has a strong link language, because the northern plains have been united for most of history. Look at India’s geography.


From Punjab to Bengal, there is nothing blocking inbetween. You can sail through the gangetic system for thousands of kilometers and is practically flat. Thus, northern empires could easily extend from Punjab to Bengal and the language/culture were bit more homogenous.

In the south, we have various natural features that limit interaction. Between Tamil Nadu and Kerala stand the mighty Western ghats. Between a lot of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu there are forests and hills. In the limited conduit there have been a lot of cultural interactions.

Historically, each state of south India had their own empires. Kerala had the Cheras, Karnataka had the Chalukyas, Hoysalas, Tamil Nadu had Cholas, Pandyas etc.

It is in Andhra things get interesting. Between Andhra and Tamil Nadu or Andhra & Karnataka, there are fewer natural boundaries and thus it is in these pairs a lot of cultural interactions did happen & common languages were had.

Andhra had thus overlapping empires with Tamil Nadu — Pallavas, Cholas, overlapping with Karnataka — Satavahana, Chalukya, Vijayanagara. Thus, in some sense Tamil/Telugu was a partial link language. But, still it was quite limited.

Due the limited contacts compared to the north, south saw a lesser need to develop link languages. Also, Prakrits and Sanskrit also worked as link languages. While it might be hard to believe the Tamil city of Kanchi was one of the key centers of Sanskrit in all of India. Cholas had their coins written in Devanagari. While Dravidian ideologues want to forget, Sanskrit/Prakrit along with Grantha script are a key part of south Indian heritage too. Just that it was a little weaker than in the north due to the geographical reasons stated above.

"When you are younger you have more liberty to talk about wealth redistribution, because you have not built any. As you get older, you realise the wealth distribution talked about is your wealth (unless you are an academic and have not built much wealth). Then you get more protective.

Again when you are young, you can be iconoclastic. You didn’t make the rules and you feel constrained by the system. As you get older, you realise you are the system. And that means you have a natural propensity to conserve the system.

When you are young, you might feel religion as bondage. As you grow older, you might still not found have your God, but realise that religion is more than just God. It brings structure, connections and stability to your life.

When you are young, you move around the world and feel the borders as stupid. As you grow older you settle down and feel that unrestricted movement of people for settlement is not as romantic as you thought it would be.

When you are young, you think of family as a chain that holds you. You try to break free. As you grow old, you cling to that chain as things start to get more lonely.

Over time, as you move from teenage to middle age your attitude towards wealth, religion, nation, social customs, family values all tend to go more conservative (Ceteris paribus). At really old age some of them tend to go back to being liberal when you are in the second childhood.

In my experience the age group with most conservatives tend to be in 30s-60s. The one exception seems to be those in or around academic circles as they interact with younger people on a daily basis and can thus contract some of the younger values from them.

You can see data and graphs here: Younger, older generations divided in partisanship and ideology"
"India has always had good friends who were willing to sell weapons— Russia, USA, Israel, UK, France etc. Given so much options, there was never a push to make many of the weapons at home.

However, there are many weapons that cannot be bought easily. Nuclear weapons, ICBMs, nuclear submarines, anti-ballistic missile defense, aircraft carriers, spy satellites — and those are made by India. Necessity is the mother of invention.

There are also many areas like rifles (INSAS), radars, sonars, explosives, vehicles, UAVs that India does produce because there is a lot of them demanded locally and the infrastructure exists.

India does produce defense tech — just that those are in spaces where the global trade doesn’t happen as much or for which an ecosystem exists locally."
"Why does the government keep nuclear weapons, but prevents people from accessing them?

Power in the hands of good guys is good. In the hands of bad guys it is bad.

Information is power."
"Duryodhana was one of the tragic characters. He was mostly a good guy who was ruined by bad guys - Shakuni, Karna, Dhritarashtra, Dushasana.

He was a child of bad parenting. His father was not only blind literally, but figuratively too. He didn’t advice or guide his child in the right way. A great king and a great father is supposed to provide wisdom. Duryodhana’s father didn’t provide any.

His mother was even worse. Gandhari closed her eyes on a whim and in the name of being an example wife, she didn’t provide any guidance, unlike Kunti who was super shrewd in raising her children.

Duryodhana displayed some wisdom & skills when he was young, but due to some bad behavior inherited on account of his parents, he was not taken seriously by his gurus - Kripa and Drona.

Duryodhana’s uncle Shakuni was even worse. He kept plotting devious ways and in the process Duryodhana lost all the wise counsel around him. Vidhura could have been a master strategist for Duryodhana had he kept his heart pure and unpoisoned by Shakuni.

Finally Karna. Duryodhana was extremely kind and loyal to his friends. He made Karna an equal king. In return, Karna should have guided his friend with wise counsel. Karna was the older guy and he should have used his humble origins to bring the grounded reality to his friend and king. However, Karna’s arrogance and over-confidence just ruined Duryodhana even more. Karna was a typical sycophant who crowds around a rich guy. He took resources from his friend, and gave very little benefit in return.

Karna gave excessive confidence about his side’s power and that factored in Duryodhana’s madness in taking Pandavas guided by the Mahavishnu himself. Krishna’s divinity was known to most wise men of the time, but Duryodhana didn’t hang out with those. After Drona’s death, Karna was made the commander-in-chief rather than a more worthy Ashwathama on Day 16. On his death bed, Duryodhana realised the folly of this.

Karna had a petty rivalry with Arjuna. But, Arjuna was not the only power in the opponent’s side. Pandavas had great personal allies across India and were able to pull those. They were guided by great seers. They had skilled warriors like the Dhrishtadyumna and Abhimanyu. Most of Kaurava side was made of those who had the historical treaties with the Hastinapura throne and not because they liked the Kauravas. And many of them like Drona and Bhishma fought only reluctantly.

It was somewhat okay for Duryodhana to feel jealous about his position taken over by the Pandavas. However, had he been in good company, he could have been weaned off of jealousy which would have changed the focus and highlighted his skills & intelligence."
"Engines contain deflection mechanisms called the cow catcher that would deflect items off the track.


These days, these mechanisms are more subtle than the early day trains, but they still exist. However, these are there to protect the trains from getting derailed and not really to save the objects in the track. At the speed at which trains travel, even getting deflected off the train can kill someone.

The best way to protect people/animals is to block their entry into the tracks. If you are in the track and don’t listen to the siren, it is hard to save you with any technology."
"Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. Sindh was not. That is the primary difference. The entire province as is went to Pakistan.

Partitioning of the provinces brought all the bloodshed, as the different groups try to show their power & majority to influence the British government to include their region on the “right” side of the border.

Punjab especially had a poorer monsoon leading to more agricultural woes and the pained populace put all the anger on the poor minority caught in their lands.

Also, Sindhis were more moderate in general compared to both Punjabis and Bengalis and were more practical than emotional."
"From about 12th century to 15th century, India didn’t have a strong domestic empire. The Palas were collapsing and so did the Cholas and Chalukyas. The Pratihara empire had already collapsed. The constant warfare had taken a toll and they were all collapsing. There were some kingdoms coming up — like the Kakatiyas, Chauhans and Hoysalas, but they were not as powerful as the earlier empires.

Think of India as the body and these kingdoms as the immune system. The immune system is mostly on to external threats. The external threats were always present. Periodically the immune system fails and the external threat takes over. The system catches a cold and then it takes time to fight it.

When there were strong empires, there were hardly any invasions. Mauryans and Guptas at their heights had warded off many threats. Same with the Mughals.

In 5th century, the immune system collapsed facing the Hunas as the Gupta empire was nearing the end. In 12th century, again the immune system was weak. Same during the 18th century after death of Aurangzeb.

When the immune system collapses, external threat that is always waiting quickly takes over. Then the fight back happens and things get restored. But, the time of these raids were far lesser than the time when the things were normal. History is such a way that you only study about collapses and failures, but not normal times."
"The question is not whether Patel belonged to BJP. He didn’t. The question is whether he was a right winger. Here is what globally accepted as right wing parameters:

Pro-religion. Was the person who rebuilt the Somnath temple pro-religion? Is there a doubt about it?
Pro-nationalism. Was the person who reunified the nation a nationalist? Is there a question?
Pro-capitalism. Patel was pro-business and a strong capitalist without a doubt.
Pro-Cultural homogeneity. Patel wanted for Hindustani as a national language. And his arguments during the constituent assembly was quite consistent with right wingers.
Right wing is not a party. It is an ideology. It depends on their outlook/approach relative to political ideologies of their opponents. Patel was a right winger by all counts. Just that BJP as a party didn’t exist then and if even it had existed, Patel might not have exited Congress for historic reasons.

Congress used to have both right wing and left wing factions in the past. Since 1990s BJP has been taking over the right wing of the Congress and that is how they were able to grow from nothing to key players.

BJP claims Patel because many of its present voters were Congress right wing voters of the past. BJP has inherited the cow politics and others of the Congress. Remember, it was the Congress that pushed for beef bans at the time of independence and was pushing for the Mandir. That section of the Congress now goes by the term BJP.

It doesn’t really matter one respects Nehru or not in this. I can be both a right winger and a respecter of Nehru. Same with Sardar Patel."
"Not really. Bradman was an amazing legend. But, it is hard to compare his time with ours. Sure, their time had uncovered pitches without helmets — making batsmen vulnerable to fast bowlers. But, he had a lot of advantages over the present too.

He practically played only one side — England. Matches with other countries — South Africa, India, West Indies, New Zealand — were less. Thus, you could get very familiar with a few pitches and a few bowlers. Unlike the present where you tour the world non-stop.
He played only one form of the game. He didn’t have to adjust back and forth.
They had no advantage of video replays and analysing the opponent weakness threadbare. Kohli’s opponents exactly know where his weaknesses are with slow-motion replays watched thousands of times and can really bowl there. Bradman’s opponents had no such technology.
The fielders of the era would not chase behind the ball nor dive. If it passes the in-field, it is pretty much a four. No Ponting or Rhodes there. And the bowlers can get into one-day mode and protect runs.
Cricket back then was not a full time profession. People worked someplace else and played cricket part-time. While it affected both the batsmen and bowlers, it made even more hard for bowlers as they are more dependent on fitness. While the batsmen could sit and hit fours, bowlers have to be in top shape to run & bowl for 5 days and many bowlers of then could not hit the gym like the present bowlers do. This is why present day bowlers have so much better records than bowlers of then.
Batting records of Bradman or WG Grace are not easily broken but the bowling records of those times are easily broken now. That should tell you something.

Look up Weekes, Barrington, Hammond, Walcott, Hobbs all had high averages. And there were not many other batsmen besides them as there were primarily two sides only playing.

If you look at test batsmen with best averages most belong to Bradman's era. Sure not as good as Bradman, but still better than other eras. Batting was not that hard then as people make it out to be."
"In 2004 elections, Vajpayee did something that no other Prime Minister did. He campaigned on positivity — of an India that was growing fast. While the previous leaders talked about war, poverty, refugees etc, here was a leader who didn’t talk about fear, but hope. The campaign primarily hit upon India’s achievements in economy, foreign policy, trade etc. There was hardly any Hindutva there.


What did Vajpayee get for this? He was voted out of power.

Many Hindus were disillusioned by the u-turn on Hindu values and many non-Hindus were merely mocking. His opponents made fun of the economic momentum he had built — with booming stock markets and trade, but hailed it as a victory for Manmohan, his successor, after he latter took over power. UPA-I coasted on that momentum. Thus, when people say UPA-1 had periods of high growth, it is like duh!

Vajpayee lost a lot of the Hindu votes and didn’t really get compensated by a lot of non-Hindus voting for him. There was no meaning for prosperity.

While the urban Indians talk a lot on growth, jobs, infrastructure, we don’t really vote on them — if we really vote at all. Those motivated enough to go to booths, still vote for their religion, caste etc.

Thus, the Vajpayee experiment taught BJP that even with 100% GDP growth, not many non-Hindus are going to vote for them anyway. It took many years for the idea to sink in.

The first major change came in 2012–13 when Modi became the face of the BJP. Until then BJP had kept Modi hidden as they were quite apprehensive of being openly Hindu. Modi was unabashedly a Hindu and this fired up the BJP’s core once again and they rode to power with a thumping majority.

Even then the government was quite cautious of its Hindutva. Their initial focus was solely on economy and foreign policy. But, as the opposition leaders mocked of his “suit-boot sarkar” as though that was a bad thing — Chinese, Japanese leaders have no issues wearing the suits and being modern — the previous plan got activated. BJP realised that votes are not going to be won merely because of good governance and statistics.

In UP 2017 elections was when BJP’s full strategy was in view. Now BJP made no attempt to court non-Hindu votes — historically the parties had token candidates to make up the numbers — and paradoxically they won even in areas with significant non-Hindus. BJP swept to power and put a very strong Hindutva focused candidate as the Chief Minister. The base was fired up. Vajpayee would not have brought Yogi, but Vajpayee didn’t win either.

BJP tried being moderate and modern. It just got mocked for it. It tried focusing on good governance. It got voted out for it. No matter what the party did, the people were going to vote anyway on religious, casteist lines. If the liberals voted where their mouth were, they might have seen the massive increase in toilets, gas connections, electricity connections, organic farming and many might have voted for the BJP. But, in India we don’t vote on economic/social ideology.

They tried saying:

BJP: Massive increase in ease of business and competitiveness.

Critics: Suit-boot sarcar.

BJP: Massive increase in building of roads and railway tracks.

Critics. You are not helping the poor.

BJP: Record numbers of toilet building and bank accounts.

Critics: Oh, some of those are still not used (nitpicking)

BJP: Completion of grid connectivity. Every village is electrified.

Critics: But, you have (not) still connected all houses (shifting goalposts)

BJP: Decades awaited reforms like GST, IBC implemented.

Critics: But, many glitches in the initial days (as though people can make major changes without a glitch).

BJP: Record number of cooking gas connections to poor households.

Critics: Meh

BJP: Record increase in electricity production especially in solar.

Critics: Meh

BJP: We brought down a huge number of shell companies, increased the number of taxpayers and tax collection, reduced communal riots.

Critics: Meh

(The exasperated BJP spokesperson is sent out. A new BJP guy comes in.)

BJP: Mandir wahi banayenge!!!

Thus, the renewed focus on mandir and Hindutva. We had good parties like the Swatantra and Lok Satta. What did they get? Nothing. What if BJP had 80% of Swantantra’s market focus and 90% of Lok Satta’s cleanliness, and gets to power on the back of Hindutva?

BJP was so successful that even the opponents are now courting the Hindus.


The politicians are like salespeople. They will sell whatever you want to buy."
"According to the legends, Ravana got a boon from Lord Shiva that he would not be vanquished by any god. His hubris was such that he didn’t forsee a threat from another man. Thus, the Rama avatar of Vishnu was made as a human and with no access to the divine weapons of gods.

Another way to look at this is that Rama was supposed to be the example that humanity should look up to and follow. His struggles were completely human and so were his responses. And that is why he among all the avatars has a whole epic dedicated to him."
"Tamil Nadu BJP unit has been a disappointment for a long time. They don’t have proper leadership and even NaMo supporters would find it hard to vote them.
Dravidian parties — DMK and ADMK — have not been that bad. When you compare with many other state governments their performance is about average. Not extraordinary, not bad either.
BJP has to build up a unit from scratch in TN that plays well with TN people’s interests.

"If I had the powers to relive a particular portion of history, I would choose the following four periods:

1000 CE in Thanjavur. It was the heights of the Chola empire and some of the grandest temples ever, were built. The Chola empire and their formidable navy not just dominated the Indian coasts, but also South East Asia. Great works of art were built and I want to see them live in action.
2000 BCE somewhere in north India. This was the heights of the Indus Valley Civilisation and my hypothesis is that this was also the heights of the Vedic culture [I personally believe these two to be one and the same]. I want to experience the grandeur of the civilisation, with immense planning of roads, trade, homes. They had remarkable standardisation and chilled out in the great baths. If they had dentists and painkillers I would permanently move there.
1930-47 CE. I want to follow Mahatma Gandhi where ever he went. I want to see Dandi march live and also the day India got independent of the British.
350 CE in Pataliputra. I want to see the ascension of Samudragupta and the beginning of the golden age of the Guptas. I want to see his Ashwamedh Yajna.
Other events I want to see include the coronation of Shivaji in 1674, the rise of Chandragupta Maurya [320s BCE] under the tutelage of Chanakya, the first sermon of Buddha in Sarnath [500s BCE] and Adi Shankara establishing his mutts."
"Ravana was consumed by hubris. He had plenty of good qualities, but it is his arrogance and hubris that brought him down. Hubris clouds your reasoning and judgment. That is how he was a party to abusing the poor messenger of Rama.

Rama was substantially more powerful than Ravana. Even without the power of Ayodhya and armed with just a rag-tag army of vanaras, he was able to defeat Ravana and the full might of his troops in his own fortified kingdom. Despite all his power, Rama was not consumed by arrogance. He bowed to the sages and wise. He was for peaceful negotiations with Ravana despite being wronged so much.

Same with Hanuman. He could have smashed Lanka and Ravana to pieces by himself. But, he humbly acted as a messenger and played a second fiddle in the war. It is the humility that makes one a hero.

One of the many morals of our epics is that, regardless of your great qualities, hubris clears them all. Karna and Ravana stand for hubris — that had wiped their great skills & charity. Arjuna and Rama bowed to the wise and were not carried away by their skills. This is why we still celebrate them as heroes."
"Everything in moderation is good and anything in excess is bad.

Our very existence is polluting the earth and almost every human activity results in pollution. The question is how much is too much.

If the little firecracker brings happiness to you and you are sticking to the rules & safety, it is not doing any more harm than taking a taxi to the cinemas or market. Just take care to not burst very loud crackers, as loudness is not the essence of the festival; brightness is. Loudness brings more discomfort to aged and children, while bright lights, not so much.

Light a lot of lamps, decorate homes tastefully, invite neighbours, have sweets and have fun. Just look to cut down the decibel levels as the tradition is to do with light and not sound.

Also realise that many of the online people who are complaining of Diwali have very high carbon footprints and not really the paragons of nature. They would be Tweeting about Diwali driving on their way to airport, without realising that that drive and that plane journey contributes to pollution substantially more than the firecracker.

When a person flies from Delhi to Mumbai he contributes to 200kg of CO2 [Aviation sources]. And dozens of kilograms of other pollutants. That is for a single economy class ticket. Business classes are substantially more. And then these guys castigate the poor kid celebrating Diwali for pollution who puts less than a kilo of CO2 in air.

If you care about pollution, take a look at your annual carbon footprint and see how much you can reduce. You can walk short distances to the nearby shop, take a bicycle to work, carry a bag to the market, take bus/metro where available, eat foods at the bottom of the food pyramid etc. Just staying off a firecracker is not going to make a big dent to your footprint.

"Widespread availability of labour pool educated in English.
Lower cost of living and thereby lower wage cost.

Building an expertise for nearly 30 years that has resulted in a well-oiled machinery to manage outsourcing. Companies like TCS, Infosys and Wipro are masters at the game than companies from other developing nations.
Compared with many other cultures, Indians have historically been comfortable dealing with Western corporate structure. They have been able to penetrate the glass ceiling far better than most other immigrants. For instance, the top tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Adobe have Indian born CEOs at the moment.

Having top Indian executives have also made it easier for Indian outsourcing, as the outsources often deal with Indian execs in the client who are more familiar with the system. In my previous company in Boston, I managed relationship with an outsourcer who was based out of my hometown in India. It was fairly easy for me as we shared the same language and culture.

While India as a society is polychronic [doing a lot of things at a time and thus missing deadlines], many other developing countries [where outsourcing economics is viable] are equally bad at keeping time. And other advantages make it simply an important destination."
"Monarchy is not a part of Hindu culture.

Take your passport and see what is in the cover. Apart from the 2300 year old ancient lion symbol of Ashoka, the name Bharata taken from Indian epics and national motto of Satyameva Jayate taken from the Upanishads, there is another key history lesson in its front page. It it the term “Ganarajya” written in Devanagiri.


Ganarajya means a republic and this was the dominant system of government in Vedic India. (See more: Gana). Gana refers to the assembling of the Sangha — a body of people. We also had the Janapada again a Vedic republic and these were quite common 3500 years ago. These were the rule of the people.

Such forms likely existed in the Indus Valley Civilisation and these forms also existed in Buddhist era. There are enough mentions of the Mahajanapadas in the Buddhist literature. You can also see similar systems in vogue across India such as the Uttaramerur model of democracy.

While the republics often had a head — they were more like the President of the present and not kings like we imagine from the TV serials. They could be elected or dethroned by the Rajasabha — the governance council. While the rule could sometimes become hereditary [like the Congress part of the present], the governance councils still had a lot of power.

When we look at Ram having to banish Sita to the forest [appears at the end of some of the later versions of Ramayana], we see Ram as a monarch who could have any kind of rule as he sees fit. Once you see as him as the President of the Kosala republic, you can see how powerless he can be with respect to the councils of the time that set the laws.

When we got independent in 1947, we took in a lot of symbolisms and inspirations from ancient India and Hinduism. Ganarajya is one of them.

India chose the republican form of government not merely because we were a British colony [most European colonies didn’t become viable democracies] because it is part of our ancient culture. The founding fathers of the modern republic brought a lot of the old systems and luckily there was no TV talkshow personalities back then to add communal colour to everything.

You can read about one of the famous republics: Licchavi Republic that existed over 2500 years ago."
"The city of Faizabad is not being renamed. It is the district containing Faizabad and Ayodhya is renamed to Ayodhya. Across India, Ayodhya is a much more known name than Faizabad. The region is called Oudh/Awadh and that name derives from Ayodhya. When even the Mughals called the region Oudh, there is no reason why calling the district Ayodhya is a big controversy.


The Sarayu banks of Ayodhya glowing during the Deepovatsav

The Ayodhya name has a huge significance. The former capital of Thailand was Si Ayutthaya named after Ayodhya. A key city of Indonesia Yogyakarta is again named after Ram’s capital. The city’s name has numerous connections in India and rest of Asia.

The city itself has thousands of years of proven history and was possibly the capital of Guptas under Skandagupta.

It is a very important city both in Hindu religion and Indian history. And the name itself has a lot of significance. The term Faizabad [victorious city] just seems to be the Arabic translation of Ayodhya. Given that Ayodhya means the same and it is much better known & grounded in nativity, I don’t see a reason to call that Faizabad anymore.

UP seems to be getting reconnected to its ancient past.

Many on Twitter complained on these name changes. Thousands of places across India carry Persian/Arabic inspired names and those are not changed. The names of two of the holiest cities in Hinduism is getting back to their original names. People said this is not respecting multiculturalism. In fact, it is respecting multiculturalism. Respecting Hindu traditions when it comes to their holiest shrines is also part of Indian multiculturalism. If you don’t understand their religious significance of those places take time to learn from your Hindu friends. India respects the cultural traditions of all.

My only request to Yogiji is that go beyond just the name change and actually change the infrastructure of these cities. In south many of us long to visit the great historic cities of UP - Varanasi, Agra, Prayag, Ayodhya, Mathura etc. But, when we get there, the appearance is very disappointing. If those cities can be cleaned up and given new parks, roads, ghats and clean water ways, that would be the real service to Ram."
"Mention Rahul Gandhi in as many places as possible & make him the face of the opposition. In a Presidential style referendum, Modi has a huge advantage over the Congress. Very few want Rahul Gandhi as a PM. By making the fight as Rahul vs Modi, BJP gets a leg up. If more credible opposition faces emerge, it can be an issue for the BJP.
Keep a strong watch on petrol prices and inflation in general. While inflation is in control, BJP might do more things [with or without sound economic reasoning] to pull down the petrol prices. That might include a combination of foreign policy and strong arming the PSUs.
Mollifying the smaller traders with a lot of sops. Demonetisation and GST had not come good for many small traders who operated outside the bounds of tax. These traders are a core block of the BJP and they had not deserted the party. But, you cannot take their support for granted and expect more sops for the MSMEs, including possible GST rate cuts and rule relaxations.
Try to win 2 of the 3 key states going to polls this year — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh. Rajasthan never elects the same party twice in a row and thus BJP has to look to win the other 2 states for sure. If they lose 2 or more states they leave the momentum to Congress.
Try to break into opposition unity. Amit Shah has a few aces up the sleeve. In the days prior to the UP state elections, a feud magically erupted in the Samajwadi Party and put it out of power soon. They broke Nitish Kumar out of the Mahagathbandan in Bihar and took back power. TRS is moving closer to the BJP, now that TDP and Congress are getting close.
Keep the mandir alive. Just months before the election, Ram mandir issue comes back and it cannot be a coincidence. In Ram, we trust.

"On 27 Feb 2002 a train containing Hindu pilgrims returning from the holy city of Ayodhya was torched by some Muslim mobs in the city of Godhra in Gujarat. Nearly 60 people died. This enraged the Hindu populace in that state and there were major calls for a retaliation. The situation was further worsened by some fringe groups that saw an elaborate conspiracy in that train torching, with some sources even mentioning a hand of the ISI with support of some local Muslims.

By next day, the state was falling into a major violence and the government was not fully prepared for it.

The state Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, was an interim leader put to prepare the state for elections after a huge feud within his party. Just 4 days before the riot, Modi won his first election to become the Member of the Legislative Assembly in Gujarat (Rajkot II by-elections: Narendra Modi pushes his own image as a rising star of BJP).

Modi was under-prepared for such a massive challenge that came out of a blue. He was a Chief Minister for about 3 months prior to that [Indian constitution allows a leader a 6 months time to become the member of the legislature after taking over as a Chief Minister or Prime Minister]. But, the administration essentially was not supposed to make major moves — it was there just to get through the elections to follow soon.

In the hours following the burning of the train, many mistakes happened. The police force was not mobilized fully. The neighboring states’ police forces had not come. The Army didn’t arrive on time. The bodies of the victims were taken in a procession in the city of Ahmedabad. There were many versions of each of these issues. Did they come from a planned conspiracy or was it due to inefficiency or just plain bad luck — depends on different interpretations. Court cases are still pending on those.

Whatever be the causes, the mobs took over the state. In an election year with major feuds happening within the political parties and a lot of power up for grabs, there was a widespread political support for violence or at the least politicians looking the other way while the mobs went crazy.

India is a severely under-policed nation. When the mobs are enraged it can be hard to contain the situation quickly.

By the time the situation got under control in a week, 750+ Muslims and 250+ Hindus became casualties of mob violence."
"An uncle of mine used to work for the government in naxal affected regions and eventually became one of the tribals. He often became an intermediate between the naxals and the government. I have had long conversations with him on the topic.

There are many types of Naxals:

The victims of landlords. Naxal movement began in areas where land reforms had not been properly taken. Without proper reforms and left to the mercies of local landlords many took arms.
The victims of government. During many of our major projects, our government had not properly compensated the people who were moved. And in the interior India government doesn’t treat people the same way as they do to educated urbaners.
The clueless urbaners. Many urban people, especially the young, have a fascination towards Communist revolution. Especially in universities you can see this happening — where people feel their corporate peers are overvalued compared to them.
The China funded Naxals. Indian Maoists and the foreign connection — Three of our neighbors are involved in active funding and harbouring groups not friendly to India. Their aim is to destabilize India.
The Naxal problem arose and spread because our governments didn’t work strong enough to bring social justice. Zamindari system of feudalism lingered decades after independence and even today remains in pockets of India, lurking under the hood. Tribals were not treated properly and were not considered as equal citizens by the establishment. Their lands were often taken for projects without due compensation. Caste based discrimination is still rampant and police has a very limited role in many parts of Indian interior.

Unlike our peers like China or Indonesia, we were too slow in bringing major social progress, healthcare and literacy to the people. Both the left and right were too scared of urbanisation and impeded progress that would have brought millions out of poverty.

The left just got too enamored of a Mao style revolution and the right was too focused on the China bugbear. Neither were too focused on India as much as they did on China. The problem exists in our lands and nobody — right, left or center is doing too much about it.

We can bring in the big guns and clear the problem temporarily. But, unless we solve the core problems they will keep coming up. Terrorism might be funded by our neighbors, but whether it is in J&K, Northeast or central India, there is an underlying problem that make is easy for the terrorism to take shape. Nobody has the patience to solve those problems."
"Shiv Sena used to be the dominant right wing party in Maharashtra. During Bal Thackeray’s time they were scary powerful, while the BJP played the second fiddle.

Now, BJP is the dominant force in Maharashtra and Shiv Sena is trying to find its USP. They are yet to get used to playing the second fiddle."
"I’m a big fan of Sardar Patel and I hate the politics the Congress leaders brought in the wake of the statue opening. That said, I am not in favor of large statue creations — regardless of whom it is for.

One of the things I love about ancient India is how few statues and monuments there were [at least what is evident from the archaeological remains]. While the Egyptians built great Pyramids [not really useful], ancient Indus valley residents built great granaries, public baths, roads and ports. Same for the Vedic society that followed. They didn’t focus on building great statues, temples and monuments, but rich republics [janapadas]. That is a matter of pride.

While the sardar statue could pay for itself through tourism earnings and on its own can be a positive, the risk is that other states and leaders start competing on the size of statue and build a lot more things not of use to people. Imagine Mayawati building the world’s largest elephant when she comes to power the next time.While I love Patel and I like Modi’s devotion for the great Sardar, I take a principled stance on building of statues. Regardless of which party built it or whom it was dedicated for."
"India has been telling Britain not to give aid and our government doesn’t accept any form of this aid nonsense (India doesn't need British aid, says new High Commissioner). India is a net donor and is providing aid to other countries and it makes no sense for our government to accept aid.

What the UK government does is to provide funding to non-government organisations based in India [not anywhere near £1 billion quoted]. Many of the NGOs in general have been quite controversial for funneling money for other purposes [not necessarily those are the ones funded by UK]. Even if they are not illegal, their efficacy have been in question for a long time.

There are a good body of research on why these narrow funding to selected NGOs are less effective to remove poverty or improve social indicators: Why the End of British Aid to India Won’t Matter.

Rather than helping it was just providing the racists of Britain to continue the idea of “white man’s burden”.

In any case, Britain is a recipient of US aid in recent times (see below), but no body questions its building of the London Eye. You might say that the quantum of US aid to UK these days is ridiculously low to even be a point and that would exactly be my point on UK aid to India."
"For the kids of our generation, Sharjah had been a source of disappointments and heartbreaks. Remember Javed Miandad’s last ball six or Aqib Javed’s controversial 7/37. Or even the time when the Indian team was bundled for only a sixth of the Sri Lankan score.

Unlike the present day, we were not used to India winning every other day. We were not used to India chasing successfully under lights. We were not used to India taking on large scores. We were just used to a team that would crumble with the smallest pressure. While our previous generation enjoyed the 1983 WC win along with World Series Cup etc, in my generation, we were used to India being at #8 in ODI rankings. In general, we were used to India failing in most things — not just Cricket.

The Sachin’s innings in that April is not merely a sporting thing, but something that came in the wave of changing the nation’s image. It is about showing India can. It was about confidence that went beyond just Cricket. Just two weeks later India boldly announced itself as a nuclear nation. Over the next few years, India became a key player in global economy.

I could talk about how hard it was to score a century in that Sharjah dustbowl and how impossible it is to score nearly 300 runs in back to back matches. I could talk about Shane Warne’s flippers and skidding deliveries. I could talk about how hard it was to chase under the lights and how hard to do back to back chasing of large scores. But, none of that matters.

As Sachin boldly stood while a dust storm engulfed the stadium, it was a magnificent experience for those who watched it live. A sort of a life altering experience for some of us. It is as though a switch has been flicked on for the nation. In that summer, Warne took off his t-shirt to get Sachin’s autograph. Bradman declared that he had never ever seen such a batsman. Lara put an end to all comparison between himself and Sachin.

Sachin is not measured in runs or centuries. He was the face of a generation shift in attitudes. It was not about Cricket. He was about hope in hopeless times. It was about a nation trying to discover its footing and climbing back to glory."
"BJP is both right and wrong on this.

First, the INC had ignored both Patel and Bose legacy. MG Ramachandran [a Tamil actor politician] was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1988. Infinitely more important Sardar Patel was given the Bharat Ratna in 1991 [along with Rajiv Gandhi who came 3 generations later and whose entire positives can be written on the back of a postage stamp]. Bose was never given. No wonder, BJP could take ownership of those two leaders — INC literally wiped their legacies.

However, BJP is wrong to imply that Nehru was not the right choice to be a PM. While Nehru was inexperienced and less grounded in reality compared to Patel, a Prime Minister’s role is not merely in administration, but being a salesperson of the country in selling the vision both in India and abroad. Nehru did a fantastic job building an image of India.

In fact, BJP did the same thing with Vajpayee. Just like in case of INC, the cadre would have voted for Advani if they had a choice to decide their PM candidate. However, the top leaders decided to put Vajpayee than Advani in 1996. Because, Vajpayee was a better face and a better salesperson who could open to people outside of his own group.

In Gandhi’s grand plan, Patel would have the power to handle India’s internal affairs and Nehru would with the external affairs. Just that Patel died quite early, leaving Nehru completely unchallenged and lonely."
"It depends less on the country and more on the class.

When I landed in the US, I was under the impression that everyone gets to choose and parents don’t care. Then the former President of our University invited me for Thanksgiving. I saw almost everyone in his family were lawyers and doctors. That cannot be an accident.

One of the women there was telling me her story of being pushed to being a doctor while she was tired of the Med school. I can really relate to that. And my experience with upper class Americans has always been quite similar. A gentleman approached me during my Zingfin days and asked me how could he use fintech tools to help his daughter get better prepared for finance careers.

While the lower and lower-middle class often portrayed in movies have non-attentive parents, in the upper-middle to upper class, parents take a keen interest in getting their children to top careers. A lot of them end up in Ivy Leagues and eventually end up in managing money or power. Senior Bush put Junior Bush in Ivy Leagues and in White House. Clintons and other upper classes do that too. It is not like they pick everything on their own.

In fact, in Boston I saw so many fellow parents training their toddlers for Harvard! How to Get My Kid into Harvard and Tips for Parents: Enrichment and Early Preparation for an Ivy League Future

Same thing happens in UK too. The upper class parents put their children in top schools and try hard to get them to Oxford/Cambridge.

In short, everywhere in the world the upper classes do care about their children’s education and do often force them into a small subset of careers.

The lower class parents, like Indian lower class are already exhausted with broken families to care too much about the future of their children. ‘Just like in the case of Bollywood, it is often these lower/lower-middle class families that get portrayed more in Hollywood."
"Keep a keen watch on inflation — especially of common food items. In the past, BJP has lost due to the rising price of onions. History shows humble onions can deep fry political class.
While you want to advertise the victories, be careful not to go overboard like what happened in 2004. Many Indians are still in poverty and it is not good to spook them.
Don’t spook third party leaders like CBN and KCR. The opposition is yet to find a coherent theme and don’t do anything to unite them."
"The concept of justice/fairness is innately present in many humans. This is why we fight for many issues that don’t directly concern our life or safety. Building a fair system is not just something we aspire to, but something of an uncontrollable itch.

Besides, men and women are deeply connected. Our daughters, mothers, wives are women. Their safety and well being are more important to us than some rom random guy from somewhere.

And it makes perfect economic sense too. Women’s rights can lead to better women education and in general, social/economic progress is often directly proportional to the performance of women in the system. One reason why India is poorer than China is that the former uses far less women in workforce than the latter. As someone who wants their nation get back to glory, it seems perfectly reasonable to want more women’s rights."
"Republic of India is the continuation of British India — with one major difference is that the people directly select the legislature that in turn elects the executive. In fact, the Republic inherited all of the treaties, rights and seats [including at the UN] that its predecessor had.

The capital is the same, buildings are the same, the official language is the same, The Republic also inherited most of the laws of the British India — including some really absurd ones that we are now throwing out. Here is one among the absurd laws that Modi has been replacing:

India finally says goodbye to its old and silly laws

Under the Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1914, an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth, and will be disqualified if he has a pigeon chest, knock knees, flatfeet and hammer toes.

The important issue with British colonialism was that we were not able to select our leaders and this meant that we didn’t have a say on how our economy is to be run, what should we trade in and what wars should we fight. That part was what we fixed in 1947."
"Shiva would be the CEO, Brahma the CTO and Vishnu the CFO. Brahma is quite brainy, but no one outside sees him as important. Vishnu funds the expeditions of the group and when things go wrong for his boss, gets into a rescue mission with his varied avatars. Shiva ultimately holds the key by being the executioner.

Karthik is the south division head — no body in the north pays attention to him, but still respect him (sort of). Kali is the HR head — in regular times, we don’t pay much attention to the kinder avatar of Parvati, but when things go wrong, she can terrorise even the CXOs.

The Kerala state representative Ayyappan seems more reclusive & inaccessible, and the company heads are still figuring out if everyone can approach him. The Bengal unit head Durga also heads the internal vigilance and people are afraid of her temper.

Ram is the perfect engineer bringing cool new ideas. Everyone in the company idolises him, but no one really follows him. His subordinate Hanuman is equally good engineer but doesn’t know his strengths as well.

Krishna is the sales head who can get deals done by whatever methods available. He is the cool dude as he drives the Ferrari and gets the girls. Everyone adores him.

Ganesha is a down-to-earth executive who mentors everyone. He doesn’t have ambitions to go the C-Suite and is a jolly type and is a natural favourite of everyone. Kal Bhairav is the chief security officer and looks quite shady.

Lakshmi manages payroll and when it comes to the salary day you hope that she doesn’t make mistakes in doing direct deposits to your account. Saraswathy heads internal training — people care about her when they are new to the company and have certificates to be obtained to progress in career.

Indra is the head of an older product division that used to be quite relevant in the early stages of the company, but now not many bother about. With his old timer buddies like Agni, Mitra, Vayu, Varuna etc he sometimes brings hell to rank & file employees. Narada is the company's Gossip Girl."
"In the earlier times, science used to be a small building. You could see the guys in the basement and the first floor. Now, it has become a skyscraper and you can no longer see the guys sitting in the top floor.

The low hanging fruits of science have already been taken. Scientists of the past have answered most of our everyday things like gravity, earth’s rotation, electricity, X-rays, penicillin, small pox vaccine etc. The newer works are quite complex and appear more “esoteric” in that we might not be using them everyday. For instance, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics went for the detection of gravitational waves, that might not be quite applicable to everyday problems. That said the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics is given for the development of Chirped pulse amplification that enables you to be have high powered laser light with a small form factor, useful in laser surgery for eyes among other things.
Until the 20th century, scientific concepts were quite intuitive to the public. You could see how gravity works and accept that everything is made of small “balls” called atoms. With the arrival of quantum mechanics, our human brain can no longer intuitively understand many of the new advancements in science.
Until the last century, a brilliant individual could make a dramatic contribution with just pen and paper. These individuals were then glorified. It has become far less likely and now science is a far more collaborative group work, requiring not just brilliance but a lot of lab resources, administrative support etc.
Until 20th century, media used to be quite limited. It was aristocratic owing to the fact that the number of things published were quite limited due to cost. As media got democratised by making the cost of publishing near 0, things have become democratic. Meaning the lowest common denominator — cat pictures — win.
In the past, who can become a hero was a controlled process — mostly by those in power. Newton and Einstein were not just brilliant, but also quite dear to those in power of that time. The powers that be showcased them as a matter of pride. Now, hero building is left to the masses and our heroes are those who brandish guns & babes on Instagram or some woman becoming super rich by merely having a sister who was famous for a sex video and large buttocks."

"It is in a continuous state of development. We have already started deploying with various top brands operating at the bleeding edge of innovation. As of Oct 2018, we have 15 of them deployed in various locations and getting trained everyday in real life conditions.

Our deployed robots have the following functionalities:

Patrolling with a fully autonomous indoor navigation — these could be used from security to customer engagement. We have a lot of key innovation in the hardware, including noiseless motion and a centimeter level precision of indoor positioning system. Children and adults test its endurance everyday and so far it is handling them all.
Fully automate reception area with our in-house visitor management system. Our robots can distinguish employees from visitors, get visitors checked in with voice, place a call to the right host, recognise them the next time over face recognition, get feedback, given them assistance in the lobby area and provide a detailed dashboard analytics with demographics data to help companies do data centric reception management.
Engaging with customers over voice. At this point we are able to answer 80% of the customer queries with specific content from the airports/malls/banks.
Do event registration and engagement for major events. The cleaned up data can be pushed into Salesforce and other CRM integrations we provide.
In each of these cases we are operating at the cutting edge. As we get better manufacturing precision, master the processes for scaling and improve our backend systems, we are looking to drastically improve the product efficacy.

Over the next few weeks, we will announcing a range of new functionalities including in HR and workplace productivity. We will be unveiling a whole new Mitra 3 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas this January followed by the Prime Minister Modiji’s interaction at the Vibrant Gujarat.

Since we build both the hardware and software platforms, we are designing for modularity and allow for a range of attachments in the future — including carrying/moving things, getting connected to a vacuum cleaner etc."
"They will yawn. It has been known for months that Google is set to announce an e-commerce initiative — Google plans global e-commerce debut from India market. I don’t think anyone reacted in any big way. Like Google Express (seriously, such a product exists) they might get not much adoption outside of their own employees.

They have been doing these things for years — Google Launches Commerce Search (2011) and Google launches same-day delivery in San Francisco Bay Area (2013)— without much impact on the market.

People often overestimate the impact these big companies have on products they know nothing about. What kind of impact did Google Plus have? After billions of dollars, it turned out to be a dud and not anywhere a competitor to Facebook. People said Dropbox and Box would die after Google gets to the Drive. Nothing of that sort happened, although the Drive is not a dud like the Plus.

Google has lost to small rivals in dozens of sectors and the only real sector they make money is in advertisements from search. Sure they have a lot of money to throw around, but their core competence is not anywhere closer to logistics and moving physical goods — the competence needed to win e-commerce."
"In the early days of our independence, Hindus had a lot of choices to pick from and Congress was their top choice. As the competition intensified in the 1970s, Congress eyed minority votes to get an advantage — including Sikhs, Muslims, Dalits and so on. They were not always successful and smaller, regional parties did better at capturing those niche votes. Congress tried harder and harder to reposition.

This trend went to an extreme that since the 1980s, Hindus don’t really have a party of choice other than the BJP. BJP built a USP around it with all their chariot politics and used that to ride to power.

In all the race to pick up minority votes, the larger parties forgot that the majority votes were up for grabs and BJP had an easy ride. In a short span, BJP became a torch bearer for middle class Hinduism, nationalism and capitalism. This is somewhat ironic given the party’s early history. Credit should go to some of the key party leaders for them reinventing the image.

Congress’ belated turn in recognising the fact that Hindus make up majority of "
"Name changes to cities are nothing new. Bombay, Madras, Calcutta have all had their names changed. If those major metropolises could handle, I don’t think a smaller city like Allahabad should have big issues with it. In the early days of Madras -> Chennai name change there was a case of a post mistakenly sent to China instead of this city. Otherwise, no big issue.

Names are about identity and says about you. A while ago, I was educating an American about Indian history. During that time, I was talking about Allahabad and its holy confluence & how it brought key Hindu leaders. He snickered saying that - a holy city of Hindus is called Allahabad?

His response was fair. I myself didn’t develop much spiritual attachment to that holy city as its name was nothing like a Hindu city. The city’s ancient identity was in the holy confluence and even today most visitors come to the city for its ancient past.

So, I don’t see any issue in getting the name to Prayagraj, although I would have preferred just Prayag — that looks short, cool and hip. In fact, well before this name change I had already used that name in many of my answers."
"India has way too much surplus electricity capacity. In fact, the capacity is so surplus that thermal electricity producers could not find many takers, leading to their near bankruptcies and that has in turn saddled the banks that have funded them. If you hear about the banking crisis in India that is due to this sector. NPAs in power sector: Banks looking at bad loans worth Rs 1.75 lakh crore

Then why do many places not have 24/7 power? This is because of the bad state of the power distribution companies (Discoms) that have been raped[1] front right and centre by our politicians. Discom losses plunged to ₹17,352 crore in FY18, says power minister.

The state politicians throw free power all the time — to farmers [who often pump out underground water at a deadly rate using that power], to poor etc. The governments don’t pay for this free power from budgetary allocation and instead let the distribution companies take all that loss. Eventually these companies become too poor to invest in infrastructure or to even pay for the power. Power cuts in a time of surplus

Often the entire grid becomes too weak with poor investment and thus power outages occur from burst transformers and other systems. Other times, the discoms cut power to those areas where they make losses — villages, slums etc.

While the central government in the recent times have provided a bit of bailout using the UDAY scheme and helped increase power utilisation—Thermal power plants’ capacity utilisation on the rise after 7 years of downtrend and the power cuts have started reducing:

Power cut duration falls 61% in May
India witnessed fewer, shorter-duration power cuts this summer
However, this is not enough to get them fully out of trouble — UDAY scheme: Discoms cut losses, but their dues to Gencos mount.

The real solution is to hold politicians accountable for all the freebies — free power, free bus passes, loan waiver etc — without actually making a budget allocation for it. They abuse the government companies and load them with their pet schemes. As the government companies fail under the load their services become poor for everyone.

"I have lived in Bangalore for a little over 2 years now. The traffic is bad and I have to often cross some of the biggest chokepoints — Silk board and Sony World. These bottlenecks have their own Twitter handles — (@SonyWorldJn) and Silk Board Junction. There was even a movie about the Silk Board.

I have lived in a dozen other cities and the traffic there was equally bad too. In my 4 years in Boston, my commute [first to my Bschool and next to my work] were both over 70 minutes, crossing barely 14 miles on freeway. This is in a city with a fraction of Bangalore’s population and wide expressways. During the rush hour it was not anymore pleasant than driving in Bangalore.

I had to often drive to Manhattan for work and that was even worse. Previously I have lived near DC Beltway [495], Seattle [405], Bay Area [101] and those commutes were terrible too. Oh, let’s not take London and its choked roundabouts. Last month, I stood nearly 1 hour, crossing barely a few miles on I-90 in Chicago. A week later, I nearly missed my flight with my taxi taking nearly 2 hours to get to the Tianjin airport from my hotel less than 20km away. Shenzhen was horrible and so was Mumbai — where I spent nearly 12 of 24 hours in Uber [Andheri-Nariman Point-Lower Parel-Andheri-Powaii-Andheri-Vashi].

The fact is that major cities are all horrible for driving. You don’t get stuck in traffic — you are the traffic, if you are in a car.

Here is how you can be a part of a solution, than complaining about the problem you are a part of:

The best way to commute is not commute. We encourage all our employees to stay close to work, so that they can walk and bike. Most of us stay walking distance away from office.
Visitors should respect the city they are visiting. If your meetings are all in Marathahalli, but you choose to have your hotel stay in MG road, you don’t get to whine about the traffic. Plan well on where you stay. Big cities are multiple worlds and don’t try to criss cross between the worlds.
When you are taking flight in/out of the city, try to do it in early morning or late night. I do that all the time and I can get to/from the airport in less than 1 hour. Do not take mid-day flights.
Take the public transport where possible. I often take bus from the airport and where possible, the metro. In a couple of years I hope the Metro connects more useful areas — south Bangalore.
If you do commute, try to take a bicycle or a scooter. I often bike in Bangalore and it is a pleasant city to ride a bike with a moderate weather. Rest of the time, I take my scooter that makes my travel around the city far more easy [while riding past all those poor, stuck cars] and do part of my tasks while stuck in intersections. I can finish reading my entire Quora feed while at Silk Board."
"Even with full consent it is like using steroids in sports and bribing to get government jobs. You are getting an unfair advantage and making things worse for everyone. Eventually it becomes a standard for others to compete even.

Having sex with the job owner is never a part of any job function. If you choose to do on your own volition you are essentially bribing and thus leading to corruption. If you are forced to do, then it is just rape. Both should be crime.

It is high time the entertainment industry gets HR functions and make hiring more transparent and fair.

EDIT: People ask why the actors are making this an issue this late. Imagine you are running for life from goons. Luckily a Uber driver picks you up. But, in return for picking you up, he asks for a kidney. In the moment where you have to decide between life and death, you accept the bargain. After you get down, you promptly call the police and report the Uber driver. Your kidney has nothing do with your ride [just the fare amount is to be paid]. Similarly an actress has to just show the acting skills and not sex. She can report about that unfair bargain at any point after feeling safe.

A person who is fighting for their career and livelihood can be desperate. A person of power trying to use that desperation to their advantage and take sexual favours is a predator, no different from our imaginary Uber driver above."
"Madhya Pradesh is among India’s fastest growing states — Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh And Haryana Top List Of Fastest Growing States. They have been among the top for a lot of the past 10 years. Nominal GDP growth

However, you cannot fix all of the past in a few years. Imagine your CGPA was 7.0 at the end of your 7th semester. Can you bring it to 9.0 in just one sem?

Madhya Pradesh had a few issues traditionally:

They don’t have a large metropolis like Mumbai, Bengaluru or Chennai. The states with a large metropolis have a huge advantage. Take out those large cities from those states and the average development is not really more than MP. Indore or Bhopal have to be converted to a large metropolis.
Madhya Pradesh is not a coastal state and states with a coastline — Maharashtra, Gujarat, TN, AP, Kerala, Bengal — have the advantage of trade and migration.
They traditionally didn’t get great universities. With the IIM and IIT brought in Indore, some of the higher education gap is getting fixed. But, still a long way to. Look at the number of institutes that Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, NCR or Mumbai have.
They didn’t have a major leader who had a clear vision. Diggy & co were great at abusing people, not about providing clarity. Shivraj Chauhan seems to be better, but they still need great leaders of stature.
They don’t have large rivers like UP, Punjab or Bihar. This had traditionally limited agricultural productivity. That said, they have done a great job in the past few years to drastically improve agriculture — T N Ninan: MP's 'miracle' agriculture

"Given Modi’s very high approval rate and same with the Mahatma, there is a sizable overlap between Gandhi and Modi supporters. Just that you tend to notice more of the haters.

This is in general true of any group — people ask why Tamils hate India, when Tamils contributed immensely to national integration and security [think Kalam, Sivathanu Pillai, Rajaji etc]. A few rotten apples don’t define a group. Some of the most patriotic works of contemporary art — such as AR Rahman’s Vande Mataran and Maniratnam’s Roja — are by Tamils.

Gandhi hatred is present in India’s millenial generation and it is not specific to the BJP supporters. Many are misguided by their bigoted parents & teachers, and some by the media. From Ambedkarites to Khalistanis to Savarkarites there are a sizable groups that have their false notions on the Mahatma. Politically, no one sees Mahatma’s value in pulling votes and thus all parties ignore him or just pay a lip service. None would want to counter the rising Gandhi hatred.

Even during the Mahatma’s time, many Indians didn’t understand his methods and they followed him just because they trusted him. As our younger generation grows up with an ignorance of history and of great things in life, they are quite likely to not understand the methods of the Mahatma. In my limited experience I have observed that, Gandhi haters grow up that way in an environment where their father or an important teacher has a strong adverse reaction to Gandhi. These children just go into adulthood carrying that hatred without a reason.

Many of the Gandhian haters have laughable explanation for the hatred. I have heard them saying Gandhi took credit for all freedom movement and Gandhians don’t give credit to others or Gandhi’s methods were effeminate. It is often the people who appreciate the Mahatma who also appreciate the many other great leaders of the movement — including Patel, Nehru, Azad, Netaji, Tilak, Gokhale, Naoroji, Rajaji etc. It is those who are ignorant of the Mahatma who are not just unaware of the Mahatma, but also cannot articulate about the other great leaders of the movement.

Gandhi hated is borne out of ignorance. Many Indians are ignorant. Many Indians support Modi. And there is a sizable overlap of people who are both Modi supporters and Gandhi haters. Same can be argued for the other way around.

EDIT: Any kind of Gandhi hatred in the comment section will be reported and blocked without prejudice."
"Going backwards:

1991: India became near bankrupt and was forced to open up the economy. This process of liberalisation created India as a player in world economy.

1977: The only time India ever had a recorded period of dictatorship ended. The democracy had been suspended for nearly 2 years by PM Indira Gandhi. Indian poor came out to vote in record number to oust the leader and showed Indian democracy is alive and kicking.

1947: India became independent from UK. This ended centuries of misrule by foreigners and started a period of social reforms and political consolidation in the subcontinent (British Raj was a messy thing with hundreds of semi-independent kingdoms working along with regions directly ruled by the crown).

1857: A revolution to attain independence [interestingly China and US too went through revolutions in that period]. It brought main changes [such as the end of the East Indian Company] some of which stay to this day — such as the importance of Sikhs and Gurkhas in military [Britain identified certain groups across the country that were found to be loyal and had them replace the majority groups in India].

1761: The last indigenous Indian empire meets defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat. The Maratha empire founded by Sivaji a century ago had a super ambitious expansion across the subcontinent meets a fatal end at the hands of the Afghans. The Marathas never fully recovered from that and their weakness paved way for the colonisation of India. To many Hindus of contemporary India, the Marathas represented the Hindu renaissance that met a premature end.

1757: Battle of Plassey brought the first main victory to the East India Company and allowed the company take over Bengal — one of the richest regions of India at that time. In another 7 decades, the company was able to take control over most of India using the resources of Bengal.

1707: The death of Aurangzeb — the last major emperor — Aurangzeb’s death started the end of the Mughal empire that had ruled India for 150 years. His hardline Islam brought a civil war that led to the fragmentation of India and rise of European colonisation.

1556: Mughal lord Akbar wins the Second Battle of Panipat and helps set up the Mughal empire in India. A whole new era for India and brought a plethora of Central Asian inspired architectural pieces across India.

1336: Harihara 1 establishes the Vijayanagara Empire that built one of the most dynamic and fascinating empires of medieval India. It resisted the Islamic rule in south India and brought a range of art revolution in the south. This empire is credited with south India preserving its ancient temples unlike the north. Their defeat at the Battle of Talikota in 1565 is one of the most sad ones for Kannadiga and Telugu people even today.

1192: At the Second Battle of Tarain the Hindu king Prithviraj Chauhan loses to the Afghan commander Mohammad Ghori and this battle ends up redefining India’s north and key cultural event whose effect is seen even today. When India named its top missile as Prithvi [the name for earth] Pakistan came with its top missile named as Ghauri, invoking that historic battle.

1078: The Eastern Ganga dynasty establishes itself in present-day Odisha and over the next few centuries they would build some of the classic Kalinga architecture like the Jagannath temple at Puri and the Konark sun temple.

1002: Rajendra Chola I builds up his campaign across South East Asia. The Chola empire is one of the fascinating empires of India and unlike the others it was less land based and more naval centric. They built some of the greatest monuments of the world and probably the most powerful empire of its time — stretching across south and southeast asia.

618: The Chalukya emperor Pulakeshin II defeats Harshavardhana. This one of the first/only recorded instance of a major north Indian emperor coming into a direct conflict with a major south Indian emperor. The Chalukyas like the other deccan empires — Marathas and Vijayangara — were fascinating for their speed of expansion.

550: Fall of the Gupta Empire. One of the golden ages of India, the Guptas brought a superior military force and enabled prosperity that reflected in science, art and architecture. It was at their time the zero and arithmetic were perfected and later taken to Arabia. Like Rome, Han China and Sassanids of Iran, they were constantly attacked by the central asians and eventually fell. The north never fully recovered from that fall. Their successor, Harsha Vardhana would fight back the Hunas and defeat them. But, his empire didn’t last.

321 BCE: Establishment of the Maurya Empire. This is the first pan-Indian empire known to us so far. The coming of Alexander to the borders of India, generated a huge reaction and this empire was the brainchild of the Takshashila University’s professor Chanakya and his protege Chandragupta Maurya. They fought off the Greeks from South Asia. Chandragupta’s grandson Ashoka, would build one of the finest empires of the world of all time and spread the religion of Buddhism across the world. Legend says that the Chandragupta was an ordinary soldier before being elevated to the emperor. His story is quite parallel to Napoleon who came 2000 years later.

563 BCE: Siddhartha Gautama is born in Lumbini in present day Nepal on the border of India. He found his liberation at Gaya and then began sermoning in Varanasi. The religion he founded became a key influencer across the world. This was a time India was exploding with philosophical ideas. India began organising itself in a collection of republics called the Mahajanapadas - Wikipedia.

There is a big gap now in our understanding in the 10 centuries before this. Many believe that India’s two epics — Ramayana and Mahabharata — happened in this era. This era is still quite unclear to many historians. There is a lot of new unearthings in this period — ASI unearths ‘first-ever’ physical evidence of chariots in Copper-Bronze age and Rakhigarhi, the biggest Harappan site, but yet to be fully connected to the Indian history.

3300 BCE - 1300 BCE: Indus Valley Civilisation. This is the largest Bronze age civilization of the world and spanned over a 1000 miles and had millions of people. They were pioneers in city building and trade. There is a controversy on their script, when they ended, who caused their end, did they even end, who are their successors etc. In India, everyone wants to be known as the successor this grand civilization.

"Unlike the US Supreme Court, Indian top court handles a range of cases — not just constitutional ones. In general, there is a respect for the top court cutting across party lines and ideologies. Thus they get overloaded with cases.

The Chief Justice of India (the senior most of the judges) has a special power to allocate cases and he can pick up from the thousands of cases to be presented now. The Chief Justice India had was an ambitious man who was not averse to controversies and who want to take on a range of game changing cases. Thus, he picked those cases up and put them to the top of the pile.

A lot of other chief justices had spent more time on simpler cases and now the court is getting more assertive. You can see a list of key judgements he brought in just one year and it is massive.

Humans are social animals and nationalism is a type of group behavior at a large scale. It comes from the innate desire to protect one’s way of life and the pride in being the best. We love to win and there is no reason why we cannot feel that our team is the best.

It is a very powerful emotion and when channelised right can bring massive changes in a very short time. Mahatma Gandhi channelised the nationalism to bring many social changes. Hitler channelised nationalism to exterminate millions of people.

Nationalism expects the best out of people and the civic pride can be used to fight the “tragedy of commons” — where people abuse public property because they don’t care. It takes you beyond yourself and makes you think for the broader society. The same emotion can also be used to silence & kill.

Like any powerful tool — fire, water, electricity, nuclear energy — it can be abused. Or it can bring massive benefits."
"This is a deluge of emotions and fears that had been dammed up for years and breaking through the social chains.

I find the force fascinating.

Sexual abuse is rampant across the world. We all know someone close who have been a victim of it. But, we have been tolerating it for way too long. This is a chance for the society to reflect and clean itself. We have to institute a range of processes to make sure our society, public places, work environments, colleges are all safe for everyone.

The #MeToo in India explodes just around the Navratri time and it is the time when Goddess Durga slays the demons. We have to help her fight the demons within. When everything else fails, Durga takes up weapons to fight.


We cannot take that literally, but adapt it to our systems. We have to build dedicated courts and an investigation agency tasked with just rooting out sexual violence. That would ensure speedy justice. And outsides of governments, we in corporate have to institute a range of workplace measures.

Speaking of this, we have to ensure that this ends up as a true movement like the Indian independence movement, and not end up in a farce like other revolutions. We have to make sure that due process is followed in punishing the predators, and that they’re not handed over to a lynching mob looking to settle old scores. Almost every revolution degrades that way.

Let’s push for more courts, better laws and faster justice. But, ultimately every punishment has to follow the rule of law. Trial by media and punishment by mobs are fraught with dangers. There will invariably be people who will misuse the movement for their own vengeance — and it is sexist to say women cannot lie, be criminal or accuse wrong. If the movement ignores that risk, it tends to weaken in the long run.

Build a proper process to ensure change across organisations, educate & sensitise the society to harassment and in general channelise the anger towards building a better society. Learn from the Mahatma’s methods and stay clear of Chauri Chaura type incidents. That will bring long term change. I say this warning because the movement might run into the risk of getting itself consumed by anger — like OccupyWallStreet, Arab Spring etc.

EDIT: A lot of people write men need a similar movement. At best it is misguided and at worst it is trying to distract social change. I don’t get why men need a separate movement. #MeToo is not about women — it is about abuse, harassment and safety. Anyone should be able to call out harassment from anyone else.

"India and USA are tied not just by a common English heritage, but also by cotton & textiles — India used to be leading textile producer especially cotton, from whom US & UK took the crown. Not surprisingly there are a few places in the US that take from Indian cities.

Madras in Oregon is named after the Madras (now Chennai) in India. Google News Archive Search. Some of the settlers in Oregon liked the port of Madras and named the city after that. In fact, at some point the term Madras used to be synonymous with cotton clothing, given the huge textile industry in the province.

There is a Bombay, New York named by a settler 200 years ago who claimed he married a princess from India. There are a few other Bombays across the US. There are then the Calcuttas — Calcutta, Ohio, Calcutta, West Virginia etc.There are the Delhis in many states: Delhi, California, Delhi, Louisiana, Delhi, New York etc.

This naming is not just restricted to Indian metropolises. Even smaller cities find their persence: Golconda (Illinois), Simla (Colorado), Almora (Illinois), 
Lucknow(Pennsylvania), Baroda (Michigan).

Not just city names. Even state names find their place too. There are a dozen Bengals like the Bengal, Kentucky. Not just the present Indian cities. In the case of Lahore, Virginia there was a shopkeeper who read about the old Indian city (now in Pakistan) and then fascinated enough to propose that time.

This is not just restricted to the USA. For instance, there is a city called Madura, Western Australia that used to export horses to south India.

[EDIT: Please don’t keep commenting that US has a Salem. It is not like I don’t know. At the very least read other comments. The Salem in USA is not named after Salem in India. It is from the Bible: Salem (Bible).]

"The premise of the question is disputable. These days I see plenty of people from all communities who are coming to the top in competitive exams. Given enough opportunities and the right environment, there is not going to be much difference between students of different communities.

Regarding the environment, in the Brahmin communities I have first hand experience, these exams used to be a life and death thing — leading to better performance. The kind of pressure is unimaginable. I got good scores in my school exams, but felt like shit getting 99.5% in Chemistry, 98.5% in Maths etc. My parents were like, you are not going to get anyway in IITs why waste time and resources on coaching classes. Thus, took a lower ranked college. A cousin of mine attempted suicide [survived after a time in coma] after being among the toppers nationwide and still missing becoming a doctor. Thankfully, both of us are doing well in life now.

A second cousin of mine became the only person in my circle to become a doctor — and she had to score a perfect 100% in Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Biology. You miss one mark somewhere due to some random examiner giving you a 9 upon 10 in one question, and your life takes a completely different direction.

In a few other OC communities [those who don’t have the benefit of affirmative action] the pressure might not be as much as they either give up [like my parents did] or might have viable alternate paths [like becoming an entrepreneur]. Of course, I’m generalising and individual families differ in their pressure/desperation level.

Thankfully the desperation among Brahmins is not that high these days — as prosperity and opening eyes to a plethora of alternate options means parents don’t keep as much pressure. As the pressure lifts, there is a reversion to mean when it comes to the competitive exams."
"India.

The Supreme Court is changing centuries old traditions in one week as the Chief Justice was retiring and wanted to put his name in history. That has created a lot of flutter especially around the staunch conservatives who want their old ways.

Unlike the US Supreme Court, the Indian Supreme Court fires like a machine gun — handling thousands of cases and giving sweeping judgments. They have taken the role of legislature on key issues, where the politicians don’t want the public ire for taking major reforms.

In a space of a few days, the court has given 4 key judgments:

Rendering LGBT legal. While nobody was really legally persecuted under a 19th century law enacted by British Raj, legalising LGBT is a key step in normalising the behavior and bringing equal rights to everyone.
Throwing away law on adultery. Like most patriarchies, we had a law whose 19th century language made women a property of men and someone having sex with the wife without husband’s consent was made a crime. Without condoning the cheating, it just threw away an one sided law and its outdated language. Their point is that marital fidelity has to be dealt in divorce courts and not in criminal courts.
Opening up an ancient temple to women. One of the key temples in Hinduism had restrictions on menstruating women from entering the main premises. This was to protect them from the journey to the temple in the middle of a key tiger habitat. It no longer makes sense but unlike other judgments this has generated a lot of controversy.
Making the government’s massive rollout of biometrics legal. India has built the world’s largest biometrics database and has made it a central piece of most welfare programs — cutting down a lot of corruption and resource wastage. This was challenged by many arguing that it will lock out those who are not in the system [suspected to be illegal immigrants]. The court ruled it legal, but then restricting private companies from using the data.
Each of these judgments are landmark ones creating wide range of precedents. All the 4 are judgements that the government wanted to have, but didn’t want to have the ire of people who oppose these reforms. Thus, the government quietly let the Supreme Court enact sweeping laws.

A lot of debates are going about each of these issues. Some are also wondering how much should an unelected body take the role of elected legislature and what the future of the court is going to be with a new Chief Justice stepping in."

"The test seems to be totally useless to me. The test tells me that I’m very likely to support the Congress and left front. And least likely to support the BJP. The test is a complete inverse of my actual political leaning.

The question asked my attitudes towards diplomacy, secularism and pluralism and just maps all the positive stuff to the Congress. Maybe it was a joint project of Kapil Sibal and Owaisi.


This is probably the most useless political survey I have taken."
"First, I don’t buy the notion that democracy is a great impediment for India. India’s non-democratic neighbors don’t fare better than India. Pakistan is a smaller replica of India, with the same history, a slightly better irrigation and more homogeneity, but has never done substantially better.

In the same way, China’s peer group of Confucian countries that are democracies perform even better than China. Finally, China was a Communist country from 1940s, but only since the 1980s did it beat India in economy. Thus, whatever the difference was, it was not really the political system.


The first key factor was the drastic reduction of births in a very short time. With the one-child rule, there were millions of women forced into abortion and the sudden lack of children gave a once a lifetime bonus. For a couple of decades, the workers bulged and were not burdened with children. As that generation retires, China is facing a big prospect of a demographic disaster [a smaller version of Japan’s] and dropping GDP growth rates.

Look at this chart below to see China’s dramatic change in demographics and how their working age population ratio rapidly shot up. But, anything that went up must come down. The curve below mimics the GDP growth curves.


India is controlling the birth rates too, but at a much smaller rate. The two countries are now seeing their favorable labour demographics intersect and thus India is getting an upper edge in growth now.


The second key factor is that China was more keen to open up key sectors such as retail, textiles and manufacturing. Walmart and other western companies entered China decades ago, while India is still dragging the foot.

India allowed foreign companies only in select industries — such as software — and those industries performed very well and provide good jobs even today. But, in industries that deal with the masses, India has kept the cards too close to the chest and has prevented the poor from enjoying globalisation that the middle class enjoys.

The third key factor is that China’s neighbors had a fantastic growth in the 1960s-70s, forcing the leadership out of their stupor. As Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore shot up, the Communist Party cannot give poor excuses for not growing. China rapidly traded with its prosperous neighbors. Other than the EU and USA, China’s top trading partners are its neighbors.


India never got the urgency. India’s neighbors were even worse than India. While China started growing the previous couple of decades and brought the leadership out of the stupor, that neighbor is still quite far away in terms of economy, culture and language. India’s trade with the neighbors thus is quite poor. Unlike China, India has no developed country to call as its neighbor."
"Think of Hindu pantheon as departments at an University. The University might have dozens of departments and even many obscure subgroups & programs, but you are not going to major in everything.

Just as major Universities have a handful of major departments [Electrical Engineering, Mathematics etc], Hindus have 6 key gods — Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha, Surya and Karthikeya and these 6 together are known as the Shanmata — the present Hindu religion is an amalgamation of these 6 faiths. They might also carry different names. Some could call it Math and others could call it Maths — they refer to the same thing.

All the departments seek knowledge and thus they are all connected to the same truth. But, they all seek that truth in different forms. You pick that particular form that aligns with you.

This one key god that you follow is known as the Ishta Deivata. Mine is Vishnu. My father’s is Karthikeya, my mother’s is Ganesha and my wife’s is Shiva. The choice reflects our own individual psychology and the presence of choice allow us to connect better.

As you keep your attention on that one key god, eventually you merge with that one all pervading force, a formless “God” known to us as the Paramatma/Purusha/Brahman etc."
"Yudhisthira and Sahadeva were too wise to need the discourse.

Bhima and Nakula were too dense to use the discourse.

It is in Arjuna where Krishna found his ideal student.

For the learning process to happen, the student has to realize his/her own gaps in knowledge. The humility that Arjuna displays across the Gita is what an ideal learner has to display. Arjuna realized his knowledge was inadequate to deal with the range of emotions that was taking over him at the start of the war.

On the other hand, Bhima was not in a mood to listen to a lecture. His emotions had already taken over him completely to give his brain spare resources to process that. He was in full rage.

Yudhisthira on the other hand was already a master of his emotions and had all the wisdom needed: his name itself means “one who is calm even in mid of a war”. The Lord could have given the discourse to him — the man called as the Dharmaraja, but that would be like pouring water into a river. (That said, Bhisma pitamah gave the gift of Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhisthira who had a quest to know more on Bhakti)."
"Like in many cities of the subcontinent the name Lucknow is from the Ramayana. It is a corruption of the word Laknauvati — or the city of Lakshmana. That part was easy.

There are many such names where the Ramayana origin is not as apparent on the surface. For instance, Awadh/Oudh that refers to the central part of UP comes from the word Ayodhya. The city of Lahore used to be called Lavapur [after the elder son of Rama].

Thailand used to be called Ayutthaya (after Rama’s capital) and their kings still call themselves after Rama — Rama (Kings of Thailand). The official carrier of Rama is currently the official national symbol and carrier of Indonesia (Garuda).

Lakshmana especially has a huge significance, especially as an Admiral of the Navy. The Navies of Malaysia, Brunei use the titles Laksamana for their Navy Admirals.

"I don’t think any major Dalit leader supports the reservation for poor upper castes, given the larger consequences. Given that Supreme Court has ruled a maximum reservation of 50%, any extra reservation for upper castes would only eat into the existing reservation for SC/ST/OBC. No politician would accept that.

The alternative is to dilute the 50% rule and keep increasing the reservation eroding what is left of open competition.

Given the current political reality, it makes no sense to support for additional reservation for poor upper castes, especially when it is going to further reduce the open competition seats."
"Building technology is hard. Very hard. Unless you have an ecosystem built for it, it is excruciatingly hard to build anything. We stand on the shoulders of giants and when there are no giants before you, things get very hard to build.

Let’s take claypots. It sounds so simple. Can you and I simply do that without the underlying technology and expertise built over generations?

There is a misunderstanding that if a company can do X which in your mind is harder than Y, then the company should be able to do Y. It doesn’t work that way. Can a rocket scientist do claypots or farming just like that, just because rockets are complex? Can NASA build office software or a search engine just because they land people on the moon? Can Usain Bolt build Tensorflow models straight away or can Jeff Bezos act in movies? There is something called a core competence.

In short, just because India can build rockets and bombs doesn’t mean we can build jet engines. Two unrelated ecosystems.

Recently, China made headlines for this: Finally, China manufactures a ballpoint pen all by itself. After years of trying, Chinese manufacturers were able to make the metal ball that goes to the tip of your ballpoint pens. You don’t even think about it while writing — but making that is that complex. There are many such items where you underestimate the complexity of building something, like the printing ink for currency notes: Modi wants currency notes, printing ink to be made in India.

If making printing inks and ballpoint pens are hard, imagine how hard it would be to get to the secret of building jets. I say secret, because it often is.

Only a small group of people cracked the core of those technologies. And the rest got it either through espionage, taking in defectors or spending a huge amount of money reinventing the thing.

India could have spent a huge amount of money and cracked those. That’s how we built our nuclear and space programs. We were forced to build those ourselves due to global laws on importing those technology.

However, in the case of building jets, there were never such a strong pressure. Because, unlike missiles and nuclear weapons, there was always a large number of global suppliers for jets and guns. Unlike China, India didn’t have as big a threat from the west to consider diverting huge amount of money to building those on our own.

Finally, India has to stop seeing the industrialists and manufacturers as thieves. Every defense production in India has been accused of bribery. Unless Indians stop that attitude towards who take the hard work of producing things in India, we are not going to make anything in India — not the jets, not the guns, not the robots, not the ships and jeeps.

Indian industrialists open factories everywhere other than India. That is sort of middle fingering the society — that doesn’t respect their efforts. Not just for building advanced items, things are so painful even to make basic items like clothes. Government has to go from being negative to a positive thing — throwing a whole range of incentives. You cannot just say “Make in India” — you have to be clear on what do we go get for making in India.

We can make advanced things only when we have an ecosystem around them to make less advanced things."
"India has way too many unnecessary laws. Given our overburdened courts and law enforcement, we should look to cut as many laws that don’t add value to the society. We cannot criminalise every undesirable behavior. Just as in the case of smoking and drinking, we have to differentiate between an undesirable behavior that is just harmful to an individual and the time it affects the society [like when someone drives while drinking or smokes indoors].

Adultery falls into this category. It is not a desirable behavior, but the matter is between the person and the spouse. It is not really a crime against the society. Thus, it has to be dealt with more civil courts — through divorce and not through criminal courts.

Imagine the case of a property manager and a tenant entering into a contract that the house is not going to be sublet. If the house is sublet without the permission, then the normal course would be to break the rental contract — not send the subletting person to prison. Using prison to enforce that contract would be a waste of society’s resources.

Regarding the sanctity of marriage defense, the marriage sanctity has gone the moment a person starts having relationship with someone other than the spouse. And thus, the marriage has to take the natural course in those cases - divorce. Punishing the external guy for the break of the marriage is just shifting the blame.

Again whenever such laws are changed people come up with the idea that the entire society is going to change and people all waiting to become homosexuals or adulterous — just because those behaviors are decriminalised. Those are not simply true — it just brings out things that already existed.

In any case, should not love, instead of prison, be the central element of a marriage? Do you need a criminal law to keep your spouse from cheating on you? If a husband needs the power of jail to keep his wife from going away from him, is he a worthy husband in the first place and is the wife worthy to be kept in a marriage?

The adultery laws were enacted when divorce was not possible. Now that people can divorce their spouse, there is no need for draconian laws to handle cheating. If a person is not going to be afraid of losing the family and children by getting dragged to the court, then an extra punishment of having her lover sent to the jail is not going to matter much.

Across the world, adultery is being decriminalised, not because the behavior is good, but because the society has bigger problems to worry than to police who sleeps with whom."
"This question has been asked so many times and it has been answered so many times. A Cliff Notes version of the event:

India did attack Pakistan and took back a sizable chunk of Kashmir they occupied. In fact, all of Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh are with India now — thanks to Nehru fighting back.
It was the longest war independent India has fought — Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948
The war went into a see-saw, where they would capture something this week and we would capture something else next week. This went on for more than a year and Indian army was staring at a second winter of fighting. Winter in those high mountains with our resources of 1948 was a death sentence for the soldiers. Even today so many die in Siachen without even a war.
As this war was going on, India had plenty of other headaches to resolve. The biggest problem of then was not Kashmir, but Hyderabad. We had to divert resources there — Indian annexation of Hyderabad. If India had put all its energies in some mountain, it risked losing the country to civil war.
As India stared at a second winter of a never ending war where both sides were locked in a stalemate, it made a perfect sense for India to go the United Nations. And the ceasefire was made with India having the advantage. Pakistan didn't like it and didn't accept the UN ruling.

Going more and risking losing the valley was not a prudent thing. And going past Pir Panjal range was very hard given Pakistan’s geographical advantage and proximity to their logistics.

No major Indian leader of that time opposed India going to the UN. Because it was a great decision. [Regarding people commenting on Sardar Patel — Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s views on Kashmir problem: What the record says — the Sardar was rightly not too interested in getting into Kashmir.]"
"Because we don’t build enough cities. When there is one pre-eminent city, it is always a tug of war during the state division. That important city would contribute a lion’s share of money to the treasury and it is always a question of money.

In Telangana’s case, the biggest sticking point was Hyderabad. It is the biggest money maker for the erstwhile Andhra and thus there was a huge fight for that. In the past, there were similar riots for Bombay [between Gujarat and Maharashtra] and Madras [between Andhra and the Madras state — Tamil Nadu]. Again, during partition there was a big tug of war for Lahore and Calcutta.

In most of the north, the division of states went smooth as they don’t have as many pre-eminent cities any more. Thus, Bihar-Jharkhand division, MP-Chattisgarh, UP-Uttarakhand, all went without much trouble."
"Because US has $$ and it won the World Wars.

By being open to immigrants and winning the World Wars, US attracted a lot of top scientists from around the world. This was very crucial to the science/tech explosion of the US from the 1930s.

In the sciences, Nobel winning research require deep pockets and strong infrastructure. It is no longer the case that a mad scientist with pen & paper with some lab infrastructure can make groundbreaking findings. To build that you need a large economy and a lot of pockets. Thus, Japan was quite successful in winning Nobel prizes more than any Asian country — they have the moolah.

The west as a whole has a lot of prizes as the previous era — circa 1700 to 1940s — was dominated by Europe. They had the best economy and thus better labs and universities. In every era a civilization dominated scientific discoveries. The previous era belonged to Europe and US is continuing that flame in the present.

Besides a strong economy, US also had strong research driven companies like the Bell Labs that produces massive amounts of Nobels.

US count is also padded with a lot of Nobel Peace Prizes that are worth nothing. In general, US Presidents and even their Secretaries of State can get the prize for buying a hotdog. In peace and literature there is more bias towards the west — as Nobel prize is a prize give by the westerners and for the westerners. Bob Dylan would win it than any Asian musician — not because of quality difference but because the European judges don’t pay much attention to Asia."
"MS is not a research degree. It usually gives you a deeper knowledge of the subject compared to what you had in Bachelors. I really loved my MS program as we spent a lot of time in things like NP-Completeness, Computer Architecture and AI than what I could have in my BE.

MBA can then take that subject matter expertise, pair it with management skills, to make the candidate attractive for upper management. MBA courses bring in elements of economics, operations, data analysis and marketing, making the candidate see both the breadth in addition to the depth afforded by the MS.

Especially for minority students who don’t have deep networks or family connections, the MS/MBA combination can help build network in two different spheres. Following the examples of Sundar, Satya and Shantanu — many Indian students try that combo.

I would not personally recommend doing any degree that is too expensive. A lot of MS/MBA programs are oversold or even outright scammy. But, if the program is good and you can afford the price and time, the combination can be useful."
"Bangalore is near the borders of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It is far easier to get to Bangalore from Hosur or Krishnagiri than say Mysore. And being a major metropolis it attracts people of all kinds. And the Kannada spoken in Bangalore has a vocabulary mix and making it easier to follow.

Historically, Bangalore has had close ties with Tamil Nadu. The oldest temples in the city are built by the Chola kings and you can see Tamil inscriptions in these temple walls. List of Chola temples in Bangalore - Wikipedia

In the same way, Chennai has a lot of Telugu people as it quite close to the Andhra border. And in the same way Mumbai has a lot of Gujarati people."
"Fiscal discipline.

It is relatively easy for a politician to give subsidies, handouts, price cuts. These all help people in the short term and help the politician get votes. However, they screw the country in the long term.

BJP workers would want Modi to cut oil prices. It is a quick way to appease their vote bank [middle class] and help them win elections. Why would Modi want to piss off the common people and lose votes? So many businesses that fund the BJP rely on petrol/diesel and would not reducing prices help the BJP appease them and get more funding? Is keeping high petrol prices helping Modi/BJP in any way?

When governments try to subsidise petrol/diesel [like they did in the past], there is a huge cost to the government. Somebody has to pay for it. Either more taxes on something else or less government spending on social programs. And paradoxically by trying to control petrol price, you take on so much debt that the inflation shoots up.

In fact, by maintaining the fiscal discipline the government is keeping the overall inflation low — India's August inflation seen easing below RBI's mid-term target : Reuters poll — despite the oil prices. It is the overall inflation that common people get affected the most — as that’s what affects their finances.

In fact, in 2018 budget [last budget of this term] Jaitley went for a little overspending — but still not out of control spending like in the previous era — to make it easy for their party workers to get some votes.


Figure: How much the government overspends?

It is easy for political parties to hoodwink people by reducing petrol prices [seen immediately] and lead to a process that increases overall inflation [often hidden in the short term]. But, Modi is resisting that temptation [for now]. When Modi starts cutting petrol prices [without decrease in crude prices] you can realise that the vote campaign mode is on. As a whole fiscal discipline is putting the economy in a healthy mode — growth without inflation.

INDIA REACT: Growth without inflation suggests higher potential"
"Bharat Bandh does help the people. I mean people working for political parties.

It is a key source of employment for our good citizens throwing stones and burning shops. It also provides automakers more jobs when they had to replenish the buses burned by the mobs.

As elections near, Bharat Bandh is a key tool historically used by political parties to signal that their campaign has begun. That they matter. That they can swing the force and have power. Like in ancient times, when different princes fight for the throne, there will be bloodshed and mayhem."
"Patriots love the land. Nationalists love the people.

Patriots would accept people of all kinds in their land. Nationalists would accept their people in all kinds of lands.

(If you need more details, you can go here: Difference between Nationalism and Patriotism.)"
"In my experience, for most Indians homosexuality is not an issue. People care more about caste, language and other things than this. At least for the Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists it is not something banned by their religion or their sadhus spent their history fighting.

When the British came to India they were shocked by the lax attitudes on this issue and thus British India became among the early countries to ban gay sex. However, since independence we have not convicted anyone for being gay [from what I understand].

Maybe parents would tell their boys, if you want to be a gay marry another sanskari boy of the same caste. They would be less outraged when their son marries a gay boy in their own fold than to marry a girl of another caste.

For many Indians, LGBT is more a shocking/unfamiliar thing than something they have hatred for. If there were a real hatred there would have been Bharat Bandh — we are country that conducts Bharat Bandhs/strikes even if a mosquito bites. In any Indian context, any issue that doesn’t provoke an immediate backlash with strikes and bandhs, is not an issue at all.

Compare this judgment with the Supreme Court striking down many provisions of the SC/ST atrocities act. That time, India burned — as it was an issue for many.

Political parties are not going to waste their energy on the gay issue and without the politicians needling people, the society will just go fine on this.

In fact, it is hard for any political party in India to take any stand on the gay issue. If RSS/BJP opposes it, they could be shamed into colluding with Mullahs and keeping ideas for colonialism. Did Bharatiyata prohibit LGBT? And in the same way if Congress/CPM opposes, they could be shamed for talking all long about liberalism and then opposing this — they would be losing their liberal base. Thus, it would be politically wise for all national parties to keep mum on gay marriages.

When Bollywood introduced gays 10 years ago, there was more discomfort. Now, it is seen quite normal to watch gays in movies. I guess our society will get used to it quite quickly as our laws of Indian religions don’t usually prohibit LGBT."
"I don’t practice Christianity or Jainism. But, I vigorously defend their right to exist and to have their practitioners enjoy the same rights given to me.

Homosexuality is like that. You don’t need to practice that to believe that they have the same rights as anyone — to marry, divorce, run a family, adopt etc.

And like religion, homosexual tendencies are partly born with and partly nurtured. And just like religion it is not a disease to be cured of nor an abnormality that will go away with time. Would you not be offended if someone says the religion you practice is like a disease and you need to go to a doctor to get out of it?

[Religion is a social construct and so is gender, marriage, family etc. And for most people, religion is not a choice — but they are born into it.]

I strongly believe in God and divine experience. For someone else it might feel weird and crazy. I’m fine with whatever they think of my spiritual ideas, but if they try to use it to discriminate me, I will fight back. I guess the same should be true for homosexuals.

People say homosexuality is not natural. But, neither is brushing teeth or wearing clothes.

People say LGBT people are not normal. I don’t know. But, the greatest people I know of are not normal either. Steve Jobs was not normal, neither was Gandhi or Elon Musk. As a general observation, everyone is abnormal in their own way.

By the way, homosexuality does occur in nature. Homosexual behavior in animals – WikipediaComing back to present politics. In India, we have never had a historical bias against LGBT and it is time we restored that. We should not stop at just decriminalising the activity [courts were not convicting people for that anyway], but go ahead in bringing equality in marriage, adoption, tax laws etc.

It will take sometime for public to get used to, but I’m sure we can all get used to the idea. A few years ago a relative of us from India came to visit us in Boston. She was puzzled with the gay pride flag that our neighbor had and the Lesbian stickers the neighbor had put in her car. My relative had no idea of what Lesbian means and she was shocked at first when explained the concept. After a few days, she got used to that and no longer had the adverse reaction. Again, I was shocked too the first time I encountered the idea as a teenager watching a TV Sitcom “Will & Grace”. Eventually, I got used to that idea and so would the rest of the society.

There is a reason why San Francisco became a key hub for startups. It was a place where it was normal to be abnormal and thus attracted “crazy” people of all kinds. If India were to progress and become a leader of innovation we have to unleash our ancient mindset of allowing practices and paths of all kinds to exist.

The places that don’t give equal rights to LGBT, are also obnoxious places for us “normal” people to live in. Because if they could punish two consenting adults for what they do inside their bedroom, they can do a lot of crazy things to everyone else.

Edit: people attacking either religion or homosexuality will both be blocked. I'm done with both of you extremists. Be nice to your fellow humans and respect their beliefs."
"Christianity is like a dictionary/encyclopedia for me. I love studying it, but I don’t enjoy those aggressively trying to sell it.

And I don’t like any religion on TV — Preachers, Babas, Gurus, Maulvi, Imams... Joel Osteen like other religious guys on TV milks money out of it — he is worth $50 million or more. That doesn’t look like spirituality to me nor would be something that Jesus would have approved of.

Osteen seems a little more modern of the Christian preachers, however he still doesn’t allow same-sex marriage and other key aspects of equality.

Outside of Hinduism, the religion I have taken the most interest is Christianity. I love the Bible and the personality of Jesus. I enjoy the choir and enjoy visiting Cathedrals.

In the US, I love visiting American families during Christmas. I love decorating the tree and attending the mass on the eve. A few years ago, the American host we had on Airbnb took them to their Church on the eve to break bread and the Bishop there personally came to meet us as we were the only non-white in that gathering. I love sharing their religion with them. I acted in Christian plays when I was young. And I have lived in US South — the Bible belt — and liked it.

However, my love for Christianity temporarily vanishes when there is an active element of conversion/evangelism. In a Christian school I studied we were forced to listen to preachers who would say all the religious practices we did until then was a sin. I wish I could punch the preachers in their nose for saying that.

This aggressive element of evangelism is there in places with Christian minority [like in India] and thus avoid the religion in those places. However, in places where the religion is confident enough to not preach to me or bring new people into the fold, I take personal interest in learning about it.

Joel Osteen is a sales person like any other preacher, and I don’t like salespeople of any kind selling me something that I have not explicitly asked them."
"This whole Twitter episode is one of Inferiority complex, insecurity and elitism.

The whole thread quoted in the question details is so tacky. People having Dr in their name tags, tickets and Twitter handles! So many of those folks talking of feminism while demeaning the poor airhostess. Classical Twitter outrage.

And the reason for this is that they have worked hard to get that. Yeah, they slaved hard moving the earth and mountains, while the rest of us chilled at the beach.

I spent 8 years to get my degrees and they were tough. Should I demand that the world call me with my degrees - BE, MS, MBA? Getting a Doctorate in many fields is hard and so is getting to the top in other professions. Becoming a good teacher is hard, becoming a good lawyer is hard, becoming a good entrepreneur is hard, becoming a good engineer is hard…. Should we call everyone by their degrees?

If we don’t use degrees of people in other cases as a title, I don’t see a reason/point to give a special exemption to Phd holders. Do the Phd degree holders call people of other professions by their title?

Yes, it takes guts and skills to finish a Phd. But how does that stack compared to someone getting into a fire day to day to save other’s lives, a soldier taking on a terror attack, a worker cleaning up toxic chemical spill etc. Should we also have Fr [fireman], Sr [Soldier], Wr [Worker] as new titles to put infront of names?

Physicians are called doctors by airlines because it could be a life saving shorthand [“oh we have a passenger fainted, good thing we have a doctor seated at 34C”]. It is not loophole to get an ego massage.

Doctor is Latin equivalent of Guru. If someone is my Guru I will call them that. Else they deserve as much respect as any other human.

The airline employee should have said — lady you have a Dr in your name. Is that your first name or last? How do I pronounce that? Dear, Deer, Door, or Drew?

Men or women — I am not going to call someone a doctor just because they have a degree. If they have an outrage for this they have a bigger problem in life."
Did the “Earth” pay for the Apollo mission or was it funded by US tax payers? Besides Earth doesn't have a flag. The closest we have is a UN flag and that is not very relevant either.
"There is no one rule for this. Do you want to move to a well constructed house or do you want to move to a new house under construction?

Developed countries offer the benefit that things are structured and day to day life is somewhat painless. However, that comes at a cost. The growth opportunities are often limited and a somewhat constancy sets in.

Developing countries are like startups. They are chaotic and have a roller coaster ride. However, if you are interested in faster growth, they might offer better options"
"Sanskrit was never a language of the masses. The Prakrits were. These were two parallel systems. Hindi is from a Prakrit and in the past few decades infused with a lot of Sanskrit vocabulary.

If people dig up our civilisation 2000 years later, they might see the various Sanskrit slogans of government bodies emblazoned in pillars, our national motto from the Upanishads written in various places, the various missile names from Sanskrit etc. and could conclude that the people of 2000s AD spoke Sanskrit. But, we know that is not true.

Sanskrit was a literary language and it was mostly confined to the elites. There is no evidence that common men spoke in an everyday context in Sanskrit.

"
"India imports more than we export. Over the years this was financed with external money — both NRI remittances and overseas investors investing in stocks and bonds. But, this is not a sustainable thing.

This can be solved in many ways:

Give more incentives to exporters through SEZs and tax incentives. Our government has never been able to replicate the Shenzhen model properly.
Make it easier to make in India so that people have to buy less of foreign products.
Make it more expensive to import and cheaper to export by weakening the currency.
The first 2 methods have not worked as well as they should have. Thus, the third method of balancing imports vs exports by allowing the rupee to weaken. The impact is already showing up as two of our biggest import items are dropping.

India's gold imports may fall 18 percent in 2018

India warned OPEC of high oil prices shrinking demand

Exports grow at 9.8% in 2017-18, fastest in 6 years

Unless we find out a way to increase exports quite fast through better support for manufacturing or change our habits of buying a lot of yellow metal & petrol vehicles, the rupee is going to fall more."
"As I wrote 5 years ago: Section 377: India is Caught in a Victorian Trap — the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is an outdated relic of the colonial era. It does not fit the ethos of India with its open mind to diversity of all kinds.

Whether you are gay or not is not the business of the government. They have much more important things to achieve than to find who is going with whom. We have to throw many such laws out and free up the police to fight actual criminals. We also have to take this legal precedence and throw out many such laws used to harass young couples and hamper their right to marry whomever they want.

Throwing this article out is a somewhat return to our past — of open minds and attitudes. India has made a USP of welcoming people of all kinds over the past 1000s of years. We welcomed people of different religions and we welcomed persecuted people — Jews, Zoroastrians, Syrian Christians, Bahai’i — for as long as we existed. We don’t need to follow their path, we just have to respect their right to exist. Our attitudes towards gays should be the same — we don’t have to be gay to respect their way of existence.

As a heterosexual person, this still impacts us because it is a change of attitude. It aligns the modernity with our ancient ideas and frees up our minds to tackle great many challenges ahead of us in building a great, happy society.

As an Indian I’m happy that the real India is returning. It has taken way too long to get here, but it is a start of a new era."
"Freedom of Speech like every other freedom is a limited one.

You have a right to move around, but you don’t have a right to trespass. You have a right to convey your opinion, but don’t have a right to incite hatred/violence.

People sometimes get in the absolutes — but there are no absolutes. Every freedom, every right, every law is made with practical societal constraints. No freedom or right or law exists in nature.

When it comes to the freedom of speech, the Americans take an extreme stance. They are usually quite inflexible on Constitutional aspects [such as taking the gun laws of 1700s as sacrosanct]. Other countries have hate speech laws like India’s.

Hate speech laws should exist and courts should balance those against freedom of speech."
"You have to stop looking these observations from merely party angle. You have to pay a key attention to ideologies. If you have not noticed, Indian politics has had a major shift towards ideology in the past 10 years.

BJP has taken over the right wing ideology. That includes religion and nationalism. This is why BJP can easily claim ownership of Sardar Patel — he might have been in INC at that time, but his ideology is very much like present day BJP.

Taking over the right wing core ideology is how BJP was able to grow from mere 2 MP seats as a startup in 1984 to a thumping majority in 2014. That means all the military victories, religious stuff — from cow laws to temples — from past governments is inherited by BJP. Majority of those who voted for BJP in 2014, voted for Congress and other parties in the earlier elections. BJP was like Netflix pulling people from the Blockbusters.

In the meanwhile, Congress has had a big left shift in ideology. When anti-India slogans were made at JNU, the Congress response was tepid. Had it been an Indira or Patel, things would have been quite different. They questioned the surgical strike, when it was a key work of the Army. Leaders in the past used to be impartial when it came to the army. Congress leaders go and bad mouth Indian Prime Minister abroad. I cannot imagine a Sardar Patel abusing his nation’s Prime Minister in front of others, no matter what was his political rivalry. Congress of today is very different from Congress of the past. They have lost their soul.

While it was the Congress that enacted the cow slaughter laws and were pro-Hindu in the past, they started turning back on their Hindu base. That’s how they lost badly in 2014. It was stupid to ignore the Hindus — when they make up the majority. Congress belatedly try to win back the Hindus, but the response is too little, too late.

Parties come and go. Ideologies stay constant. What BJP did in the past 10 years was to take the core ideological base of Congress, leaving the grand old party dry."
"Modi could lose the elections. But, chances are less.

In 2004, Vajpayee’s BJP didn’t have a majority. They depended a lot on coalition. In 2014, Modi’s BJP is on much solid ground. They have been winning most of the state elections in the past 4 years.

More importantly, Vajpayee had a strong adversary. Sonia Gandhi was very shrewd lady, more like her mother-in-law. Modi’s key adversary, Rahul Gandhi, is worse than even his father — already a lower standard for their family. Helping Sonia were leaders like Mulayam, Jyoti Basu, Lalu, Karunanidhi etc. Now, Basu and Karunanidhi are dead, Mulayam left a broken party to his son, an aging Lalu is besieged with more scandals.

Vajpayee was brought down by two key things — Gujarat riots and an excessive focus on showing a Shining India. Modi has not had a big failure yet in his term and his popularity has been on an upswing.


Three Years In, Modi Remains Very Popular

Key threats to Modi:

Inflation: Overall inflation is quite stable. However, if oil prices continue to grow, it would be harmful for him. It is quite likely that the government would start cutting the taxes or even bring petrol under GST in the run up to the elections.
Getting defensive: While Vajpayee in 2004 went overboard with positivity, you cannot become like Narasimha Rao in 1996. A sullen Rao was defensive of his liberalization credentials. Modi cannot become like him — he has to unabashedly stay true to his home base without spooking too much.
Losing state elections: It looks possible that BJP might lose Rajasthan and one of the other states this year. That could set a negative tone and upset the momentum.
All said, Amit Shah has studied the 2004 failure really well. He doesn’t repeat many mistakes."
"MBA in US is super expensive. Most middle class Indians cannot afford it. And you have to take a sizeable loan to keep you afloat — I am not a fan of taking hefty loans for education. You cannot work during the period as the program is very demanding.

I could not afford an MBA [despite having worked in the US before that] and thus could pick only those schools that gave me a scholarship. That drastically limits your school choices. I could not afford any kind of prepping or coaching programs that most students going to top MBA schools take. Also, I skipped on overseas exchange programs, staying on campus and a lot of the study material — as I could not afford them. Thus, I didn’t fully capitalise on my MBA program.

My friends who got the benefit of the full program also got loaded in debt — although some of them who got top jobs in tech could repay it relatively faster.

If you are a middle class student [like I was] I would not suggest an MBA in the US — especially with the prevailing visa situation. You would put your family through a lot of financial hardship."
"You are comparing the earnings of top 0.1% of actors versus average teachers/scientists. That is not a fair comparison.

What does an average actor/singer do? In India you can see them singing in temples, trains and weddings. They will act in street plays, drama and wait years in abject poverty. They will do all sorts of odd jobs. Do they seem rich to you? I have not seen as many scientists begging in the train showcasing their research talents.

The very best [or luckiest] get out to the top and get rewarded for taking the risk and years of toil. Rajnikanth did a variety of odd jobs while acting — including being a coolie, before becoming a bus conductor and eventually getting a break in cinema.

The teachers and scientists who have gone to the top of their profession AND have taken the risk have gone substantially richer than most actors. Byju is richer than most Bollywood actors. Same with the folks who run popular coaching centers across India. They are extremely rich.

Among the scientists there are many billionaires — the ones who were able to take their science and put it into entrepreneurship.

In life, the reward is proportional to risk. An average teacher/scientist does not take much risk in life. They often get into career paths of less risk and then get into a government job and have job security. The flip side is they are not going to get rich.

On the other hand, actors and some teachers [like Byju] take risk and could end up filthy rich or very poor.

If you want to be rich — be at the top of whatever profession you take and take appropriate level of risk. The risk would come in taking the untraveled path and not satisfying society’s norms. Even if the profession is cleaning toilets, you can become very rich and famous if you do that well — the guy who turned public toilet running into a 600 crore empire."
"I’m not sure what list you went through.

We are among the most diverse startups. We have people from 3 different religions. I have no clue or idea about what castes they belong to. We have people from 8 states of India and collectively they can speak 10 languages.

We have among the best women representation in the industry with women working at all departments — production, hardware R&D, software R&D, product management, operations and marketing.

Our company culture prides itself on diversity and anyone who has visited our offices can see that. In short, stop trolling."
"This question has been addressed multiple times over the past 18 months. Let me try to summarise:

More taxpayers: Nearly 1 crore people were added to tax net and the 26% rise in filings is not proportional to GDP growth or population growth. Fighting black money starts with eliminating at source — get people to pay taxes. With 99.49 lakh new tax filers, income tax returns surge 26% in 2017-18
Less shell companies: A key way the black money is moved around is through shell companies — that are businesses that don’t run any business. By tracking the money coming back to the RBI, lakhs of shell companies were outed. Attack on black money distribution. Over 2 lakh shell companies to be struck off from records in FY19
Less gold: Most of us know that black money moves around through gold, real estate etc. and not a lot through currency. However, it is the currency that leads to gold. Demonetisation along with other transparency measures, made India get down from the gold crown. Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China

4. Real estate valuation drop: Most of us know that the key way black money goes around is real estate transactions. That market had a big drop — especially with cash transactions. The superheated Indian real estate is coming a little closer to reality. Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt

5. Tax amnesty scheme: Government gave a one time option for people to come clean — by taking a 50% cut on what they deposited in the bank. Thousands of crores of rupees got through that scheme and that once again led to reduced black money. India launches new tax evasion amnesty scheme to unearth...

6. Money to other government bodies: Using the demonetisation move, many local government bodies and even religious institutions accepted the older notes and they got all their past due paid in one go. Demonetisation sees six-fold jump in Gujarat municipal tax collection Again, this would show up in the 99.3% too.

All of these are directly on black money. Indeed most of the money came back and it was never a stated aim of demonetisation that money should not come back to RBI. The aim of demonetisation is to add transparency to the system and it did work — as you can see evidence above.

And it was a bumper year for tax collection — Direct tax collection exceeds target in 2017-18 and What demonetisation did to tax collections. Government gets more taxes — is that not the stated outcome? If tax collection is increasing and tax payers are increasing that means untaxed money is falling. What is black money if not untaxed money?

The common man didn’t pay all the extra lakh crore worth of taxes last year. Where did that extra come from?


I’m sorry — are you still peddling the idea that demonetisation failed?"
"It has to come in multiple steps:

Electrify all the trains: Indian Railways is the largest consumer of Diesel in India and in the next few years every locomotive will run on electricity (hopefully!) — Piyush Goyal wants it by 2020 — Railways targets full electrification with Rs 35000-crore plan although the finance ministry is pushing the deadline further so as to not waste the existing Diesel infrastructure.
Building dedicated freight corridors to reduce trucks. Indian railways has been building dedicated freight corridors to reduce dependency on trucks and diesel. East, West freight corridors likely to be commissioned by March 2020. They are also working on taking smaller loads away from trucks — Indian Railways new dwarf containers have 67% more volume; could be a game-changer in capturing high-end traffic
Move majority of the personal transportation to trains: In the next 10 years, almost every city in India would have metro trains and that would mean significant number of people would be using trains running on electricity than cars running on petrol. India to build 700 km of new metro lines. We have to be like western Europe in this — in England and the Netherlands majority use trains and public transportation.
From the trains to their homes, have electric buses: Indian cities are now heavily investing in electric buses. Delhi to Fight Toxic Air with 1,000 Electric Buses - Mercom India and India’s first-ever hydrogen fuel cell powered bus by Tata Motors is here!. Also combine this with cycles for last mile travel.
Move all electricity production to renewables and nuclear: India is heavily investing in solar, wind and nuclear and should generate most of its energy from these sources than coal and petroleum. India added more energy capacity from renewables than coal last year
Electrify all the homes: In the next 4 years every home should be electrified and that should reduce the Kerosene consumption significantly. India to achieve universal electrification under Saubhagya scheme
India’s future is not electric car. But, it is in electric buses and metro trains. And electricity produced with renewables in combination with nuclear [for night time] and new age battery technologies that doesn’t use Lithium — World’s first thermal battery plant to be unveiled in Andhra Pradesh today.

I would say this is entirely possible in 20 years. By 2040, India’s metro trains and railways infrastructure, along with buses running on electricity/fuel cells in combination with other last mile infrastructure will remove the need for oil."

"Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Bose.

This would balance the right and left. There might be a bit of tug of war for Ambedkar in place of one of the leaders. Finally there might be a compromise and a 5th face will be put."
"One of the biggest fallacies is that real estate prices don’t fall. Such stupid concept bring excesses and bubbles periodically. This is how ordinary home buyers were binge buying in US and Europe and got into a massive mess. Everything can fall.

I have seen first hand how real estate prices can fall. In the late 1990s I have seen my relatives struggle to sell property in India as it was constantly falling after the la-la early 90s.

After demonetisation real estate prices did fall in India and lakhs of homes are waiting to be sold. Many property developers went bankrupt.

Residential real estate prices drop 3% in big cities.
4.4 lakh unsold homes in 7 big cities at 2017 end: JLL India
The reason it has not fallen further is due to the opaque nature of the market [with limited data and outside money] and the historical difficulties in repossessing property from insolvent owners and then putting it up in auction. Rich owners hold on to their unsold homes for a long time — in denial — and at some point they have to bite the bullet and sell at the low market prices prevailing — setting a spiral.

Why real estate market might face more hard times in the future:

Population growth is flattening. Other than UP/Bihar, most Indian states have attained replacement rate in fertility or lower. That means having less than 2 children on an average. Fertility in India is declining rapidly, says National Health Profile 2018
More homes are converted to apartments: Across India we see individual homes are getting converted to apartments and that means more efficient use of land.
More agricultural lands are converted to homes: Across India, a lot of agricultural land is getting converted to homes. India has over 350 million acres of agricultural land and even 1–2 million of them converted to flats can be be used to build 100–200 million flats and that will just flatten up the market without reducing food supply any bit.
People have been priced out in most cities: In most Indian cities even the middle class is priced out and cannot afford to buy and even rents have become unaffordable. The ones who buy do with the hope that the prices will grow [not that they can afford]. Since they are buying just for price rise, they will get into a panic selling mode when they realise the prices are not coming back in a long time.
Growth is getting more spread out. With more cities getting metro rail, expressways and other amenities, the growth is getting more spread out rather than being concentrated in just a few cities like Mumbai and Delhi. As states like Bihar experience rapid economic growth — Bihar is national topper in FY17 growth, with 10.3 pc — there might be fewer migration out of them to bigger cities and in fact might reverse some of the earlier migration, leading to our large cities losing some of the population. Betting on small enterprise, Bihar's migrants are returning; here's why
In short, if you assume that real estate markets in the priciest cities of India will just grow the way it did in your father’s time [especially in 2003–12] you might be in for a rude surprise. The market fundamentals are going to be tough. As an end note, this is what happened to Japan."
"Not in the nearby future. Sony’s AIBO is a consumer oriented product and is a proof of concept in providing companion robots —with key emphasis on how different parts of the robodog makes animal-like movements.

Our strengths and challenges are different. The technical challenges we face are:

How do you move a human sized object around a room with grace?
How to navigate autonomously in crowded environments precisely knowing what part of the floor it is occupying, while avoiding humans and other objects? If you ask it to take you to conference hall A [as a receptionist function] or take you to the smart TV section [in a retail environment] it should be able to do.
How to provide computing and motor control with a battery life lasting for 12 hours [our battery is about 70 times bigger than your normal power bank] while still having a charging time under 4 hours?
How to have reasonably good conversation with the user?
How can we have an accurate face recognition and demographic data collection?
How can we recognise the object the user is having in his/her hand and the clothes he/she is wearing, to be able to make inferences about the behaviour?
How do we collect user data and integrate that with Salesforce and other systems, giving rich analytics?
How do we provide more emotions [through eyes, fingers] to be able to engage the users better?
How do we have a manufacturing process that can help us quickly build, assemble and deploy the robots cross the world?
How do we provide software integration with a range of services — phone calling [for visitor management in reception areas], email, slack etc.
We have to do all this as a bootstrapped startup without having the financial backing of a company like Honda, Softbank, Sony etc. Most importantly we have to do all this without failing like some of our predecessors — almost all the major ventures in our industry [Boston Dynamics, Aldebaran, Honda Asimo, Sony’s previous AIBO] got either closed or sold out. That requires focusing more on end applications and delivery schedules than merely cool features.

This is our previous version and our next version will be launched in a month with a range of emotional delivery. These 10 challenges above are themselves daunting for us to venture into consumer robots."
" have answered this question a few times. I will try to simplify.

Right wing means those that support existing power structures. Who typically has power? Government [army, police etc], religious institutions, cultural norms, traditions, businesses. The alternative to power is anarchy.

Thus, right wingers typically support the State and its sources of power [army, police] along with religion, business, tradition etc. Of course there will be some friction between these different entities — materialistic business would conflict with a spiritual religion, just as some traditions collide with government’s objectives. The push for foreign investments in business would generate friction from the nationalists. And so on. These contradictions are inherently common in any political ideology.

Left wing means those who seek to overthrow existing power structures or at least change them. They tend to support unions over business owners, and whatever entities they think are weak — including tribal rights, women rights and those of the rights of sexual, religious, linguistic minorities.

Again, people constantly have compromises. For instance, many in the Muslim right wing in India would check all the boxes for right wing, except that they might vote the left wing for the reason that left wing supports minority in general. In the same way, a person who supports the BJP in India, could be supporting Democrats in the US. Again, always remember who is in power and whether those in power look like you? Also, does the change in power equation is good or bad for you.

Left wing in two countries might align — in fact, Soviet Union wanted a grand soviet spreading across the world. However, right wing across different societies might not always align — as the power right wing X is trying to protect might conflict with power structure Y is trying to preserve in a different country. Thus, unlike left wing, right wing doesn’t have a global ideology and can thus face the brunt of overseas media.

Right wing is about continuity, preservation and stability. Left wing is about change. These are in general terms — sometimes they end up doing opposite of that."
"Cities pay more taxes than villages.

Rich people pay more taxes than poor people.

Educated people pay more taxes than illiterate people.

The goal of running a government is to tax from places where there is a surplus and help grow areas where there is a deficit. If you are not doing that, you are not running a government — just a mere business.

India cannot become a developed nation until areas that are suffering a vicious cycle of poverty, overpopulation and illiteracy are brought out of that cycle. For that to happen there will be some reallocation of resources.

And it is fair too as some of the larger states in the interior — UP, Bihar had some of the lowest budgetary allocation per person, since independence. States like Bihar and Bengal had to give up part of their prosperity so that we could have cities in other parts of India flourish through the Freight equalisation policy.

Look below on amount allocated to Bihar vs all India average from the five year plans — and you should not be surprised why the state didn’t perform well. No investments, no major education institutes of repute, no major highways or airports. Social development cannot happen in vacuum.


(See More: Why does the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh seem least developed in most terms even though it neighbors the country capital? )

We want entire India to prosper and to have a range of economic activities across India. If UP and Bihar too catch up with growth and have their own Bengalurus and Mumbais, they might not be migrating out in as much numbers and that might calm down some of the chauvinists who claim their cities are getting overrun. And if those northern cities become key economic centers, the southerners too will have more job opportunities and more trade opportunities."
"As political discourse deteriorates in India, the extremists in right wing and left wing are inventing new labels. Urban Naxals is a new term the right wing has created to label the left wing supporters. It is term mostly popularised by a script writer named Vivek Agnihotri.


Just as terrible as the term is the sheepish arm chair war over Twitter with another trend [It is #MeTooUrbanNaxal this time]. The buttons for both the wings are so loose that they could be set on with a mere breeze.

The Naxalbari rebellion is a key uprising in India where tribals with the alleged help of China fought the land lords as well as the government. Depending on which part of political ideology you hold, they could be seen either as terrorists or saviors of the tribals.

For the right wing, Naxal is one of the worst epithets you can throw and urban naxals are those who sympathise with Naxals or their supporters.

And the definition of who a naxal is very vague and can be very wide. It could be a neo-Buddhist dalit activist. It could be a preacher actively converting tribals to Christianity. It could be just a journalist questioning local landlords and politicians. Some might be outright Hindu haters. Others might be just sceptical about large scale projects in India’s interior. Some could be funded by China. Others might be just questioning the need for rehabilitation of tribals moved by dam projects.

The Urban Naxal is a wide brush that puts all these disparate groups under a single bucket. And it might result in arrest of people who need not be.

The left and right wing don’t see a need to respect one another and using terrible labels for anyone/any idea that they don’t accept."

"For a long time, the Indian government wanted to incentivise the states that have done well in population control. This was done by freezing the Parliament seat allocation and finance assistance from the center based on 1971 population levels than current population levels. Thus, those states that have grown a lot in population since then will be punished with fewer seats/population and fewer center resources.

However, we have to realise the problem of vicious cycle and the chicken and egg situation. Bihar’s and UP’s fertility rates have to come down, but they cannot come down without a lot of investments in education, health and social progress. You don’t need to convince an educated working woman that she should not have 5 children. In fact, you might have to incentivise her to have even the replacement level of 2 children.

In short, education and jobs are a better solution to population control than forced sterilisation. However, for education and jobs to come there has to be more investment. Since the state government itself is indebted and poor in those states, the assistance has to come from the union.

This is why I support the 15th finance commission’s move to use more of 2011 census with still some incentives for states that have strongly worked on population control. Without fixing the problems of India’s overpopulated places in India’s middle, India’s core indicators cannot be fixed.

A number of people keep writing below that the south is being punished. I’m paying more taxes than my maid — does it mean I’m punished? No, I’m sharing the benefits I got with people who don’t. That works between rich and poor, urban and rural, also between rich and poorer regions of the country."
"Others have talked about the positives. Now, here is a negative.

Before Jio came, I had a phone line that worked. Airtel was friggin expensive, but when pressed the dial button I was sure that I will be connected.

Now it is a Russian roulette. I have 4 different SIMs across two phones as I need to be connected all the time and I am not sure which network would pick.

Yes, overall Jio changed India, but it also resulted in much lower quality of connection overall as its competitors drastically reduce price without increasing investment."
"Both the assertions are questionable. China has a number of periods of warfare and multiple kingdoms. In the same way, India has had periods of unity under many empires.

This is Han dynasty — one of the important dynasties and you can see how the area under pink is a small part of present day China.


Same for the Qin dynasty who united China for the first time.


Under Tang it became bigger, but still less than 50% of present day size.


It is only in the Ming that the present day China’s borders started resembling more and the highest watermark was reached under the Qing a couple of centuries ago.


This is India under the Mauryan empire — somewhat analogous to the Qin empire with a majority of present day India under one empire:


India’s equivalent of the Han is the Kushan empire. The present day calendar and many other elements come from that era. They ruled only about 30% of the present territory but were very significant for cultural change.


India’s equivalent of the Tang dynasty where the arts and sciences exploded was the Gupta empire.


India’s equivalent of the Yuan dynasty is the Mughal empire — both built by outsiders. The empires came about because of infighting among the local kingdoms.


India’s equivalent of the Ming dynasty is the Marathas — but unlike the former, the latter lasted a lot fewer time. It was a time of rebirth and a lot of present day identity comes from that time.


India’s equivalent of the Qing dynasty is the British Raj. In both cases the outsiders took over and ruled. Both regimes ended in the 20th century. Both Qing and British Raj were the highest water marks when it comes to the land area.

Inbetween these, we had a lot of important empires, just as the Song and Jin empires ruled various parts of China successfully, we had empires of the Cholas, Satvahanas, Rashtrakutas, Vijayanagara etc.

In case of both countries, the present day borders came about in the modern era and came more due to the conquests of the outsiders.

Finally, India didn’t always require one empire/system to succeed. Unlike China, the emperor had lesser control compared to the social systems and religions in place. As Confucius said, if a society has well defined protocols you don’t need to rely too much on laws.

Thus, unlike China the time inbetween the empires was not consumed in civil wars and unrest."
"There are many similarities that are covered by other answers. Thus, I will cover just 1.

Almost every major organised religion of the world comes from either India or Israel. This includes the big 4 — Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism — as well as the religions like Judaism, Jainism, Sikhism etc. There is something in them that made them be better at creating the right environment in creating lasting religions.

EDIT: People asked about how Islam is related to Israel. Start from: Abrahamic religions. Islam is a continuation of Judaism and Christianity. Many of its core ideas [including the banning of pork and usury] come from these religions and the prophets such as Abraham and Moses are common to all the 3."
"The religious obedience works mostly inside the temples. At least in the south, the major temples are relatively cleaner inside [relative to the crowds they handle]. Even in the north, where there is some strong organisation the temples are maintained well. Look at Akshardham or Bahai’i temples for instance.






The problem is that people don’t have community pride and attachment towards public spaces. We don’t see the town or city around us as part of us. We assume that there is a government that will do the things and we have little to do with the government. Even in temples where you don’t feel a part of the temple organisation you tend to be careless in throwing away stuff.

On the other hand, within a temple run by a closely knit organisation — either managed by the ASI or closely involved with a religious head — people take community involvement seriously and do their part in keeping things clean.

Again, within my apartment complex things are quite clean. I can jog for 500m around the complex without worrying about filth. It is in fact cleaner than my apartment complex I lived in Boston. There are people who regularly clean and the residents feel a connect. It is not a hopeless case. I have noticed this in almost every gated community I visit.

Same in the case of office complexes. They are usually quite clean as there are staff regularly cleaning things and people feel a connect.



Inside our huge higher education complexes such as in IIT, IIM, BITS etc things are quite clean. Again the same reasons. Whenever an organisation is strong and committed to things — be it a temple, apartment complex, IT park, mall, airport, university — the result is quite good.

However, in all the cases there has to be gates to prevent random, unauthorised, uncontrolled access. Once anyone in the general public of over 1.3 billion move freely, it is pandemonium. Build gated islands where there are very high standards and then link up those islands to create a very large oasis.

In short, in India itself we can draw enough examples of places that are quite clean. The key is to bring people feel connected to the public space, take pride in it and also not have them feel hopeless, by having enough staff dedicated to cleaning.

"
"I don’t know what the actors said and in general don’t follow the politics of cinemamen. I want to address the alleged inferiority complex.

There might be few north Indians who look down upon south Indians, just as a few south Indians who look down upon north Indians. This is a fundamental human problem across the world.

But, separation is not a solution for this. In a hypothetical nation of “South India” the egos of Tamils, Kannadigas, Malayalees and Telugus will be quite a lot and each will look down on the other. I have seen how these egos work and how much violence can result out of these misplaced complexes. I know of people who claim Tamil as the oldest language, Kerala as the most prosperous region and Kannadigas as the friendliest group. Reality is different, but ego has nothing to do with the reality.

Again within a single state there are certain regions that look down upon the others. Some Chennaites have the superiority complex over people coming from smaller cities. And within Chennai, south Chennai [almost all Indian cities have their southern side more prosperous than their northern side] does not have a high opinion of the parts north of the river Cooum.

In within south Chennai there are quite a lot of egos and complexes arising out of religion, caste, class, educational qualifications etc.

In short, splitting countries is not going to solve really the problem of egos and complexes"

"In the finale of the sitcom FRIENDS, the character Phoebe creates a panic by stating that the plane has no phalange. The panicked passengers think that the fictional thing of phalange really should exist and get out of the plane. I think some parties are trying to replicate that in the real world.

There is no concept called the “national disaster” in India. The government classifies disasters as L0, L1, L2, L3 and this disaster is given the highest level — L3. This allowed NDRF and other central forces to be deployed.

There is no law or provision in India under which a calamity anywhere in the country can be declared a “national disaster”.

"The question is how would you define a robot for these tax purposes?

Should Google search be considered a robot for this? It is a software agent that takes your query, goes and searches databases and brings you a result that a librarian would have done.

Should the macros in Excel be considered as robots? Should the various assembly lines in factories be considered as a robots? Did Bill Gates’ company not displace and replace workers in many industries? Why did he not ask to be imposed a voluntary tax when he started up?

You cannot just randomly impose taxes on a new industry. If automation and job displacement were the criterion, start imposing taxes on textiles, car manufacturing, software industry etc.

Ultra rich people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet are asking for onerous taxes after they have climbed up the ladder that allowed them comfortable tax benefits. Looks more of hypocrisy than a well thought out idea."
"The state will rebuild itself and move on. Some of the plans are already outlined here: A Step at a Time: How Kerala Can Start Picking up the Pieces

In 2005, Mumbai had historic floods where 2x more people were killed in a single city than in the entire state of Kerala now. The city rebuilt itself and moved on. In 2015, Chennai had historic floods and the death/property loss in the city was comparable to that of Kerala. The city was rebuilt in weeks and life moved on. Our home was in the epicenter of those floods and was amazed how life returned to normal in days — and we had our family events [60th birthdays of my father and father-in-law] celebrated in the planned manner in that same month.

Same thing in Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Assam, Bihar etc that have all had historic calamities in the recent years. Life moves on. Given the size and scale of India, calamities are nothing new. And our culture is built around moving on and we don’t store the sorrow for a long time.

Hopefully lessons from why this calamity happened is learned and implemented in practice. That is how Surat rebuilt its image after the historic plague of 1993.

There is enough that could be done and I have covered this in earlier answers: What measures would you suggest to control extreme situations of drought and flood occurring nearly every year in our country which costs us a huge loss of economy and lives?"
"Here are the things that this summer interns did: Internship 2018. We had 18 of them from top institutes in India, US and Israel. And we take internships very seriously — every intern is expected to help in product development.

Paradoxically, we don’t really look for robotics expertise. That is as vacuous as saying you computing experience or you are interested in computers. Robotics is a field, not a product. What part of robotics are you interested and what specific skillsets do you have?

For mechanical engineering interns, we look for the following skillsets:

CAD designing skills ideally with Fusion 360. I’m amazed how few of the mechanical engineers can use a good CAD tool. Designing skill is must for a mechanical engineer.
Familiarity with rapid prototyping techniques. You cannot just know what 3d printing is, but need to know how FDM is different from SLS. Need to work with our vendors — give them the designs, assemble them, see if that component works and if it does work with them to fabricate the prototype and integrate them in our system.
Product/industrial designing skills. While we don’t expect a perfect industrial designer, we want people to start thinking in terms of the products they see around them. What makes the pen, water bottle and phone around you special? This keen eye for product is very essential.
Ability to work with mechanical instruments — drilling, cutting, welding. Engineers have to get hands on in building things. We don’t allow engineers to just plan from their desk and not execute it on the ground."
"It would have been a civil war and done more harm than good.

In what way did Jinnah deserve to become the Prime Minister of India? He was not a major freedom fighter — at least not since 1917 — and was not really popular among general public. In the landmark Indian provincial elections, 1937 Jinnah’s party didn’t even win the areas that is now Pakistan. Why would his party be given the control of whole of India?

If the Congress party had just given away the Prime Minister’s post just because the guy was a Muslim, there would have been a massive internal rebellion. The party would have broken up and across India there would been a massive turmoil.

For many Hindus it would have been a betrayal. There are many parts of the society that accepted the British rule only because it ended the Islamic rule. Now, to bring Jinnah to the top just because of his religion and not for any inherent merit, it would have been a complete chaos.

That kind of a gambit would have worked only if the Congress had known and predicted Jinnah’s death soon after independence [Jinnah died within months of independence due to poor health]. You could not have bet the nation on the nature of medical progress."
"Because it is massive and unusual. Over 400 people have died in the floods — Bodies found as floods recede in Kerala, death toll rises to 400 — and it is not normal or usual. Even in Assam’s floods rarely these many people perish. In Kerala, even well constructed homes and airports have faced the brute force of nature.

That said, we in general forget about disasters happening far. Bihar, Assam and other states also deserve our attention when they have historic floods (like last year’s historic floods — Worst flood in 29 years hits Assam). As a nation, we need better processes and empathy."
"I’m not a civil engineer, but as an engineer I will say the following — prevention is better than cure. You cannot really protect your home if your streets look like rivers.

Our water management is horrible. We don’t desilt the lakes and canals in time, leading to flooding and lack of sufficient water storage. Rather airports and other development are constructed blocking natural water flow. Kerala floods: This village residents say Kochi airport is the source of their misery
Need more dams and canals. As climate change worsens we will be having more such disasters requiring us to build more dams and storage.
Take off encroachments. Big and small establishments, apartments and shops often take up lakes during dry years. When the wet year comes they are under water.
Stop unregulated construction of homes and resorts in forest areas. Rampant deforestation has left the mountain slopes unprotected and leading to landslides. Environment strikes back
Ban sand mining. This is what happens to our rivers during dry times. Source: Sand mining in Kerala. The sand mafia illegally takes off the rich alluvial soil from the rivers. What is often left are rocks that cannot hold a deluge of water. In nature, that soil acts as a storage of water during floods and can help provide water during the dry times. That crucial soil is taken away in the watch of government."
"That is a silly and stupid argument.

First, India’s tax-GDP ratio is substantially lower than in developed countries. List of countries by tax revenue to GDP ratio. In developed countries [OECD] average tax taken as a percentage of GDP is 34% and in India, it is 17%. In short, Indian governments are not robust in tax revenues.

Second, even in the developed countries, people chip in during major calamities. One of the foolish attitudes Indian middle class have is in seeing government as something alien. Government is us. Their money is ours and so are their problems. That is why we are called a Republic.

You cannot fix India’s problems by not working with the government."
"Money never comes without strings. The people who give the aid often expect “gratitude” that turns out unreasonable and costly. It promotes a kind of image that we are trying to get out of and interferes in doing business. Go through the following three headlines as a Exhibit A from our ex-coloniser talking about gratitude.


Well that's gratitude! We give India £1bn in aid, THEY snub the UK and give France a £13bn jet contract

They give 1 billion sometime and want 13 billion worth of deals. Nice math.


INDIA is set to land on the Moon AND Mars – so why do we pay them £100 MILLION in aid?


India spends $6 BILLION on Russian missiles – yet UK pays them £60 MILLION each year

Britain gave us a few millions in aid in the long past and expect billions in business deals favoring them. Yeah, nothing is free. Even if their government themselves don’t directly ask and claim the tabloids like DailyMail or Express don’t represent them, there is a huge public pressure created by media that see India as poor, indebted to them and should wipe the floor for them.

Thus, the foreign aid has always turned out to be “penny wise, pound foolish”. For a few crumbs here and there, we get to lose a lot in the long term. This is why the major parties in India have avoided going with the begging bowl to the outsiders.

UAE still has plenty of ways to help Kerala. They could invest in the state through FDI and FII routes. Their companies could set up greenfield factories in the state or bid road contracts for rebuilding the state. If the quality fits, they could import products from Kerala companies. They could also buy and transfer technology to the state in building new kinds of homes, water purification etc.

Just as the fishermen who saved a lot of lives graciously said no to aid [""Don't Want Money For Saving Lives,"" Say Kerala Fishermen Who Braved Flood Water To Help Victims] it is often prudent not to accept aid that often come with hidden strings attached.

Every government that has ruled India in the past 15 years has had the same view — whether it is BJP + coalition in 2003, Congress + Communists in 2004, Congress in 2013 or BJP in 2018 — the policy has been consistent for all states across India. There is no reason to turn this into internal politics.

Even in case of much bigger disasters such as the 2004 Tsunami, 2005 Mumbai floods, Kashmir earthquake, 2013 Uttarakhand cloudburst and Chennai floods 2015 — India didn’t take external aid. How would that policy be broken for this case and would it not be unfair to others? To put in context the 2005 Kashmir earthquake had a total casualty rate 200x of the Kerala floods. Given the size and scale of India, natural disasters happen every year and we cannot let our states go with the begging bowl every year.

If you want to help, invest in new opportunities and trade. Visit as a tourist. Spread the positives that happen there. And countries like Maldives giving us some paltry sum is more insulting than helpful. They have snubbed India a lot in the recent past and there is no way we can see their $50000 as an act of kindness. Had we taken the money, they will rub it on for a long time as though our existence depended on that.

And it is not as though UAE has wired us the money and it sits in the bank. What is quoted was a proposal and given how governments work, it might take a long time to reach if at all.

In short, there is a strong reason why India has avoided foreign aid during calamities for a long time. Thanks, but no thanks. If you want to help a country — India or any African country, invest in their technology, visit and spend on tourism, purchase their products, promote trade, write about good things happening in their country etc — but keep the alms to yourselves.

EDIT: Other than an informal tweet, there was nothing official about UAE announcing an aid to India: Kerala floods: UAE says nothing official yet, no amount of financial aid announced"
"They can and they do. Not just a single company, but an entire industry. In 1969, India nationalised 14 of the largest banks holding 70% of the total deposits. 70 Policies — Nationalisation of Banks, 1969 | ORF

They also took up airline industry, coal industry and many other industries. Such horrible policies were common in the post-World War 2 period when governments thought they can do a better job at running oil companies, banks, railways etc. Some countries quickly undid the mistakes while others doubled up.

EDIT 1: English East India Company was not nationalised as some mentioned in the comments. Just that their precious asset India was taken over by the government. The company hang on for a while, went bankrupt and now run by an Indian. East India Company returns in UK

EDIT 2: The benefits of bank nationalisation is controversial. While the number of branches grew in rural areas and more accounts got added, until 2014 India was among the least banked countries. And hundreds millions of those unbanked population were brought into the fold not by some government nationalisation but through incentives. Chart: One of India PM Modi’s biggest achievements. You don’t need to nationalise to push banks into rural areas — give them the right incentives [positive and negative]. This is the part that was missed in India for a long time, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty and missed chances."
"I remember the summer of 1998 — May 11 to be more precise. When the announcement came that India tested its nuclear weapons, it was unbelievable. I had three months of vacation in school that time and I spent every day of it reading the newspapers in full. It was the birth of an entirely new India.

To me the comparison was Sachin Tendulkar’s innings in Sharjah just 2 weeks before the test and one of the greatest one day cricket innings ever. It was the “never say die” spirit that tied both the events that summer. It was so superbly enriching for the children of that generation. It was so refreshing and so powerful.

Now, the sports column got far more interesting with Sachin and the rest of the newspaper got far more interesting with Vajpayee. We children were creating a plethora of charts and other material in schools to talk about PARAM the supercomputer, PSLV/GSLV satellite launch vehicles, thermonuclear devices, Agni missiles and so on. It was as though a button was flicked and all we could talk was technology.

India was a fairly timid nation until then. In 1974 we did a nuclear test, but we went elaborately about how it was just a peaceful explosion for energy research. We prepared for tests in the early 1990s but the Prime Minister chickened out. PVNR for all his credentials was not a man of great conviction and took the lowest risk path always. The liberalisation came not out of mind change, but out of compulsion from outside. And when the Americans threatened about nuclear tests he promptly backed out. But, the pits he created for the test stayed.

Vajpayee was a bold man. Within weeks of coming to power he okayed the nuclear test and the preparations that followed are stories of lore. How the scientists sneaked out escaping all the CIA surveillance and went ahead with the test is like hearing a superhero story.


Some of India’s greats — Vajpayee, Kalam, Chidambaram [head of atomic energy]

And when India did the test, it was not apologetic. It didn’t say it was some research. It said we are now a nuclear power. That boldness characterised Vajpayee.

US did impose sanctions. But, India pushed hard on the Resurgent India Bonds and got NRIs (non resident Indians) to send enough money to make the financial sanctions a joke. Vajpayee Government woos NRIs with Resurgent India Bonds, makes impressive gains

Two years later, US gave up and President Clinton had an arousing welcome in India and was a high watermark of Indo-US relations. A great testament to Vajpayee’s eat the cake and have it too. US now respected India far more than it did before. A generation before then US was warring India [a nation with no advanced weapons] and a generation later, it has led to deeper relations: US upgrades India’s status as trading partner on par with its Nato allies. People respect only if you have power.

Vajpayee took India through some of the low points and ended an era that was gloomy. Late 1990s to 2001 was a period of sorrow. The Kargil war, the attack on Parliament, the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus, the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane and the subsequent negotiations involving the release of top terrorists. That era was absolutely horrible.

Vajpayee guided India out of the landmines and by 2004 we were not about terrorism or war. The argument was just on how much the economic growth reached everyone — not whether economic prosperity took place. The stock markets and home prices bounced back from the doldrums of the late 1990s and were rollicking by the time Vajpayee left power in 2004.

The India of 2004 was not just an India with nuclear energy and better relations with outside world, but was also an India with expressways built everywhere. Vajpayee is the Eisenhower of India — in guiding us through the ambitious NHDP program that connected India’s major cities with world class highways. Airports improved substantially and now we had metro trains running in Delhi and getting planned in other cities.

Terrorism in Kashmir was dwindling down and overall there was peace across the country barring a large riot in 2002 in Gujarat. Alleged mismanagement of that riot cost Vajpayee his job and nearly ended Modi’s career.

If it was PV Narasimha Rao that brought the liberalisation of Indian economy in 1991, it was Vajpayee who boldly stood for it and went modernising it. One of the best Prime Ministers India has ever had."
"Before the arrival of ADMK, the DMK won two elections — one in 1967 and another in 1971.

In 1967, Annadurai was helped by a number of factors including the inflexibility of the central government in Hindi — leading the agitations in the south and the more casual/careless attitude of the TN Congress under Kamaraj. Kamaraj famously remarked that he can win even while sleeping. Helped by all these factors, anti-incumbency and Annadurai charisma they won a little more than the half-way mark.

In 1971, there was no opposition as the Indian National Congress aligned with the DMK leading to an easy victory for the party under Karunanidhi. An ageing Kamaraj who broke out of Indira Congress, gave a feeble opposition and didn’t even stand as an MLA.

It is only from the next elections they actually faced a competition and Karunanidhi was no match Ramachandran’s publicity antics and personality. Thus, DMK lost out in 1977, 1980, 1984. Even while MGR’s government was dismissed by Indira Gandhi in 1980, he rode back to power quite easily.

MGR had a better knack of winning people both in the upper and lower classes/castes and he had a remarkable pull power created out of his movies. Only after his death when the ADMK was in disarray could the DMK get to power.

In 1996 they won on the back of a massive public hatred/backlash for Jayalalitha and her coterie — including Sasikala and Dinakaran. In 2006, they again won through Jayalalitha’s high handed attitude that had alienated many sections of the society including teachers and upper castes.

In short, DMK’s victory was when there was no real opposition or the opposition took the elections too lightly or made huge blunders."
"Why do poor people send children to school? Could they not spend just on food and essential items alone? Why do they invest in children “so early” when they are not going to get to work for a decade or more?

You cannot get to tomorrow by just doing things that keep you sustained for today. Unless you invest in tomorrow you are going to be stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty.

What India spends in space is a very small fraction of what India spends in social welfare programs. Even if you completely close down the space program it is not going make a big change in our welfare programs.

Thus, India has to invest in today [food security, healthcare] and tomorrow [space, energy]. And the hope of a better tomorrow will propel us forward today.

And the space technology is already paying off quite well as ISRO is making money launching satellites of other countries and also benefitting our defense and other ministries.

India is not a poor country. It is just a rich country that has gone through a temporary state of poverty and getting out of it.

"There are many parts of this argument:

First, Hinduism has historically placed more emphasis on oral transmission of knowledge than written. Elaborate rules are created on transmission of this knowledge called the Vedas. For thousands of years they have been transmitted without apparent discrepancy. Unlike Christianity or Islam, Hinduism didn’t need to have scribes or books for it to propagate — leading to lesser works by Hindus than a comparable civilization size.
Second, India has been through invasions where many of the records were destroyed. For instance, the ancient university of Nalanda was destroyed by an invader from Afghanistan. Pics: Why was the world famous Nalanda University burned? While China has been through invasions too, their invaders [Mongols, Manchus] were not religiously motivated and were more interested in integrating than overthrowing the culture. Thus, China’s records were better preserved.
Third, India’s climate in the tropics made it bad for preserving manuscripts. China has a colder and less humid climate — helping it preserve artifacts better.
Most importantly, Indians did write history, but most of these are underutilized: Did the Hindus Lack a Sense of History? — It dispels the myth that there are not enough written records. It is just that Indian history gets far less attention and investment. Unlike the Chinese history, most of the work is done by foreigners — with their own difficulties and limitations in doing an excellent job. There is written history — many of which are not fully utilized. https://www.thestar.com.my/trave...
Indian history is more of a mystery. A century ago we didn’t even know about the Indus Valley Civlization — the largest civilization of its time. Its script is yet to be deciphered and in parallel, a huge body of Sanskrit manuscripts lie without getting processed. The Puranas and Itihasas - whose equivalent are considered history in other parts of the world, don’t impress some historians as much because they have the religious layer. That bias is leading to less utilization of Indian past."
"Surprises or mysteries in Indian history:

What happened to the Indus Valley Civilisation and how connected are they to the Vedic civilisation? Are they one and the same or different?
How come all the major Indian empires collapsed in the 12th century — Palas, Cholas, Gurjaras all ended in ruin, paving way for foreign invasions. How come across India we had a simultaneous fall of regional empires?
The dramatic rise of Marathas [nobody else have fought in as many different directions as they did in that short a time] and their speedy downfall. Shocking!"
"Those who had a radio in 1947 were fairly educated and wealthy. They were more likely to know English than Hindi. Despite the central government actively promoting Hindi over the past 7 decades, still many don’t understand Hindi. Back in 1947 a large chunk of people in the south and northeast had no knowledge of Hindi.

One thing people don’t appreciate now is that Hindi was not the language of the masses in 1947. Before Bollywood, AIR, Doordarshan, central government jobs and universities brought out Hindi as a common language across most of northern India, there were a range of other languages/dialects that people used. 90% lived in villages and those spoke Bhojpuri, Brajbasha, Mythili and other regional languages. Eventually they were made fun of by the city educated peers and were brought in line with Hindi. South of Vindhyas, even in Maharashtra Hindi was not as commonly used 70 years ago. In fact, the people used the older Modi script to write Marathi until the 1940s when officially mandated Devanagiri became widely used. In short, Hindi and Devanagari were not as common in 1947 as they are now.

The speech was addressed more to the educated class — both in abroad as well as in India — and the idea was to have them simplify and convey the ideas to the masses around them. Thus, a school headmaster, a businessman, a civil servant or a Congress leader would listen to the speech on radio and would be translating in local languages to the masses curiously listening to them. The press would also be publishing the story, the students would read them and educate their family.

Even if Nehru had made the speech in pure Hindi, there still required a translation to the common masses with the first language as Hindi — as education was quite limited and the complex ideas conveyed in the speech was not easily understandable."
"Many reasons why caste system continues:

India is still quite rural. Only about 30% live in urban areas [compared with over 60% in China]. Many of these 30% are quite small towns and not large cities. Large cities can break many of the caste tendencies [it alone cannot magically break everything].
Women are not quite liberated. In this we lag behind even Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. When the women have more mobility and independence, they can break down some of the existing system — including caste. As you can notice intercaste marriages are higher among working women.
Castes are closely tied with ethnicity, diet and culture. People want to retain the cultural aspects and we have to figure out a way to collapse many of the castes that share common culture, diet etc.
The benefits offered by reservation go to a narrower group than reach widely. Reforms to remove creamy layer off the reservation benefits have not gone well due to political reasons. When a wider section benefits from reservation, there will be more social mobility and weakening of caste.
Upper castes don’t have as much incentive to pull down a structure that benefits them. Lower castes that have tasted power squandered the opportunity to fight caste. Like the Animal Farm, they got comfortable with the tools of discrimination. When given the power, Dalit leaders like Mayawati wasted time and money in building elephant statues and continued to milk caste based difference [such as pandering to the Jatavs in case of Mayawati or targeting Yadavs in case of other leaders] than eliminate them.
Religion has gone weak. In India, caste permeates every religion, but the leaders have neither the authority nor the incentive to take caste out of the equation. In Hinduism, there are no more towering authorities of the caliber of Vivekananda, Rajaji, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Bharati, Ramakrishna, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Raja Ram Mohan Roy to continue the reforms they were doing a 100 years ago. Other religions are no better either. If religious leaders can truly understand the dangers caste poses to their religion, they will have better urgency.
Racism was not fought by wiping out races. In the same way caste system need not be fought by wiping out castes — a goal that might never happen. Rather, the goal should be set on wiping out the caste based discrimination. But, such goals are not properly prioritised.
Convenient scapegoating that has taken pressure off groups that practice horrible discrimination. For instance, Tamil Nadu has for decades blamed Brahmins for casteism and decades after the Brahmins are out of power, the state leads in violence against Dalits — Tamil Nadu leads in crimes against dalits. Unlike the Brahmins, it is a political suicide to name the top castes that commit such violence. The narrative of Dravidian egalitarianism masks horrible caste issues especially in the deep south and the northern coastal districts."
"Those Tier-2 cities with a better climate.

As our expectations on living standards rise, so would the queue for cities with a favourable climate. You can see how Bangalore got transformed from a pensioner’s paradise to a tech giant — with the primary advantage being climate. For foreigners as well as returning expats, Bangalore is the first choice and new businesses often grow around it.

We have to plan for more such cities. Next in line could be Pune, Coimbatore, Mangalore, Kollam, Panaji, Chandigarh etc.

Besides these, we also have to look for cities like Vizag, Vijayawada, Kochi, Surat, Nagpur, Jaipur that will be developed as the next in line cities that will grow the fastest in size. It is better to plan metros now than 10 years from now."

I don't like the Indians

—- President Richard Nixon (Snubbed by Indira, Nixon never forgave India)

Nixon: …need—what they [India] really need—is . . . a mass famine.

Kissinger: They’re such bastards.

Source: Unholy Alliances

US policy in 1971 war was quite dictated by Henry Kissinger — the then National Security Advisor and a truly horrible human. He was involved in war crimes around the world and not tried in ICJ only because he belonged to the world’s most powerful nation [The Trial of Henry Kissinger].

Nixon [the President at the time] was not a better individual and he wanted to have a big famine in India [Nixon and Kissinger’s Forgotten Shame]. Karma is a bitch and Nixon was the one to bite the dust 2 years later for a trivial issue.

US policy post-World War 2 was often devoid of morality and they have overplayed & burned their hands with realpolitik. They have destabilised elected governments in Iran and elsewhere, and have brought horrible choices to the people in many parts of the world. Thus, the question of supporting dictatorship over democracy — didn’t arise. They simply didn’t care about that dimension.

As numerous tapes show, Nixon-Kissinger had a personal hatred for Indira Gandhi [Indian Prime Minister of that time] and India. They also believed that India was a client state of the USSR and weakening India is key to destabilising USSR’s power in Asia.

At the end of the day — US just had a big embarrassment like in other wars of the time as the horse they backed, lost horribly. The new nation of Bangladesh got created despite the US building a coalition to prevent it.

"When it comes to Modi or many other Indian topics The Economist gets outright silly and pathetic.

The article complains that Modi changes clothes 4 times a day and advertises himself.

Politicians travel a lot and attend a lot of events every day. Why can’t they change clothes inbetween? They represent the public and have to put their best image.

Politicians do advertise themselves. So do business people or actors. They all depend on the public to buy their stuff. No different from the Economist advertising itself.

What will be the next complaint? That he brushes with Colgate and doesn’t use toilet paper?

The paper also had inserts about lack of press freedom. Is there a major newspaper in India that is ideologically closer to the BJP? How about major news channels like the NDTV? In fact, criticism for this government has been louder than previous governments, leading to the Prime Minister skipping press conferences altogether. If the press were in his control, would not be doing more media conferences?

As the media runs out of genuine criticism, it is nonsense like these that get printed. No wonder a lot of the UK/US media are going through a financial crisis. Keep publishing such articles and we will read the obituary about your newspaper."
"I think there is some more distance to go and RBI is letting it find its real value.

There is one thing commoners miss while reading currency fluctuations. It is that they are dealing with two variables. It is not the rupee that is weakening, but it is the dollar that is appreciating. Let me illustrate.

About 5 years ago 1 Great Britain Pound equalled about 101 rupees. Now, it is worth only 89 rupees. One Euro bought about 85 rupees, now it buys only 79 rupees. A Brazilian real equalled about 26 rupees and now it is about 18 rupees. A Russian rouble equalled 2 rupees back then and now it is on par with the rupee.

In short, the rupee was getting stronger over the past few years against many other currencies and that was worrisome to many economists and exporters. In fact, not long ago publications that are highly critical of the BJP were complaining that the Indian government was keeping the rupee too high.

A Rising Real Exchange Rate Hurts India's Exports

This is one of the reasons why RBI has slowly let rupee weaken so that the exporters don’t lose out to their competitors abroad. Since inflation is not a worry now, they are more comfortable doing this. Many economists are asking the RBI to go even further. Rupee still overvalued by 5-7%: NITI Aayog’s Kumar

A weak currency would increase prices [inflation] especially those you import. On the other hand, a strong currency would reduce jobs — as many export industries [such as IT, Jewellery, textiles] would suffer and imports would start replacing many homegrown companies [toys, electronics from other countries would be cheaper than local products].

In short, currency question is a question of inflation vs jobs. For a while the government and RBI were more concerned about inflation and thus pushed for a stronger currency. As job growth suffered they had to balance it now.

There is also a question of getting exports to get on par with imports. For a long time we have been importing more than we export and you can think of that as akin to borrowing money when you are spending more than you earn. This cannot go on forever. We have to get to a balance by weakening currency where the import starts reducing [as price of import increases, people cut down on purchases — such as taking fuel efficient transportation modes, skipping a phone upgrade etc] while exports start increasing eventually to a point of them becoming equal."
"Freight equalization is probably only a small factor in south India’s growth.

The population of UP = Tamil Nadu + Kerala + Karnataka + Telangana

On the left side there are zero metropolises. On the right side there are 3.

Massive, massive difference.

In 1905, the city of Bengaluru was electrified and even had electric streetlights decades before the northern towns did. More than half of homes in UP and Bihar are without electricity [as of May 2018], while Kerala has 100% electricity to every home.

The two international airports of UP handle a combined volume of about 7 million passengers per year. To put it in perspective, Bengaluru alone handles about 27 million passengers per year and Chennai about 21 million. Bihar has no real international airport when Tamil Nadu + Kerala have 6 international airports between them [the population of TN + Kerala = Bihar].

You can take any metric - be it crime rates, women participation, literacy, school drop out rates, the southern states have been beating the northern ones for a long time.

The difference between the development of southern and northern states are so huge that it cannot be attributed to a single policy.

Madras Presidencies was one of the better run British provinces while the Princely states of Travancore and Mysore were way ahead of any of the northern kingdoms.

UP/Bihar/Bengal had fallen behind in economy long before the Indian government established the freight equalization policy in the 1950s. The population growth of the northern states have been substantially higher than the southern states. The governance and bureaucracy of the northern states have been substantially poorer than the southern states.

As mentioned in my many previous answers there are many issues ranging from poor leadership from colonial era to the present.

But, one critical item is that UP is a ungovernably large one and a holdover from the colonial era. In other parts of India such large provinces have been broken into more manageable parts.

This is India before partition. Almost every other part of India was drastically changed. The United Provinces (UP) still remains as is with just a cosmetic change to the acronym.


Unless UP and Bihar are broken into more regional units and some sense of regional identity and pride is brought, they cannot easily compete. Some northerners proudly claim they have no state pride and that is not something to be proud of. Without state pride what dominates is caste pride and religious divide."
"Narendra Modi [should not surprise my critics or my supporters].

The economic growth is strong, the GST is getting smoother, infrastructure projects are going in full swing, inflation under control, foreign relations are good and key reforms such as the IBC, RERA, JDY have been introduced. Energy shortage have drastically come down and new metro trains are coming up everywhere. There have been no major scams, controversies, terror attacks or riots. There is no reason to disturb the applecart, especially when the alternative is not clear at all.

In 2004 elections Vajpayee lost and could not enjoy the tailwinds that came as a result of his actions. The period from 2004–07 had a strong growth due to the Vajpayee government reforms done in the previous years such as the NHDP. The UPA enjoyed the honeymoon period with a fast growing stock market, stable inflation and good external relations [Nuclear agreement 1–2–3 happened in the one year period since Vajpayee left].

I hope Modi doesn’t lose out on the tailwind that would come from the good stuff they have done. Given that they are in power in most states and is soon to take control of Rajya Sabha, they can push for the more tougher reforms in next term."
"Nah. I in fact love London. I love going to the theatres in Piccadilly Circus, love taking the tube and in my most recent visit, I did a road trip around England and Wales. I loved taking the sweaters off at the Lords balcony (remember the Natwest series of 2002) and going to the Wimbledon.

Colonialism was bad. The Raj was bad. But, most ordinary Britons had nothing to do with it. They were as much a victim of the gentry as we were. The ordinary Britons were more supportive of Mahatma Gandhi and the freedom movement.



Shows like the Downton Abbey show how much the ordinary Britons were helpless in the face of feudalism even in the early 20th century. And almost all those gentry who were part of the horrors in India are dead. While I still hate the gentry that is behind publications like the Economist and the BBC that tend to give a negative, gloomy view of India, they are but a minority.

In short, I have no reason to hate the present British people or their country. We learn from the past and move on. In 1947 we had a gentlemanly agreement and sent out the British with respect. And we still remain in the Commonwealth.

Happy Independence day!

"There are plenty of scenarios in which you won’t have a loss but still might end up deep in red with cash.

You have bought a lot of inventory. It is not a loss, but you have a big cash outflow.
You have spent a lot on R&D. It is capitalized and not counted as an expenditure. But, it still took cash.
You have sold a lot and booked profits, but have not gotten the money for it. The customers might pay 60 days later, if they do.
Especially in the early days of the company, profits and cashflow might diverge wildly. It is more important to pay attention to the cashflow than to profit in that stage."
"A city without a train transport is not a city, but a mere urban jungle.

Every great city in the world has a viable train transport system. New York, London, Singapore, Delhi, Tokyo, Beijing, Paris … all have excellent train based mobility. Trains are the only way to carry a large mass people across a huge city.

Delhi was a complete mess in the 1990s. When I studied in school I was always amazed by how crazy and undeveloped the capital’s transportation was. When I visited the city again in early 2000s after the metro, the effect was striking. Whenever I land in Delhi, I take the metro these days — it is so effective.

Even the puny and barely developed Bangalore metro is quite useful for many. I try to use it where possible, and it's effect will only multiply as more routes are connected. Kolkata metro too is quite useful on many of the routes and has reduced the chaos the city was in the 1980s. I like the Chennai metro too given its connectivity between the railway station, airport and bus terminal. But, still a long way to go.

Many of the new metros with just a single line are not as useful in its current stage, but as more routes get added and as infrastructure gets built around the metro its full potential will be seen. Hopefully, in case of Kochi, Jaipur and Lucknow they develop the next lines faster and don’t be content with the namesake state they are in now.

To summarise, the government invests in metro trains because without them the cities would collapse in their own weight. That said the routes they select seem to be a more showoff."
"The BJP government is trying to mimic the Rajiv Gandhi government in this case — overruling the Supreme Court for votes and appeasement. This can potentially backfire as whatever votes they could gain could be offset by the votes they might lose.

I don’t need to debate anything on the issue itself as the courts have already done that enough.

If anyone can be arrested and put in jail based on a mere complaint, why do we even need courts in this country? If the law enforcement is weak to prevent crimes on Dalits — the fix should be there, rather than building draconian laws.

The same is true for many of the women laws and other laws we basically overturn the foundation of justice — that a person is presumed innocent until proven otherwise.

BJP must be careful — in its eagerness to widen its base, it cannot break fundamental logic. People voted for the Modi wave because they believed he would be strong and not bend to every interest. Remember what happened to the Congress."
"Yes, indeed. Like every state in India.

Kerala state percapita income is about $2400 and is lesser than Egypt and Philippines — both of which are below rank 100.

Kerala sure has done a lot of good starts, building on the effective administration of Travancore. It has produced some of the finest civil servants for India - VP Menon, E Sreedharan, TN Seshan, Verghese Kurien etc. It has spearheaded a good universal literacy drive starting from Ernakulam. It has a better healthcare reach than most Indian states and has a very good connectivity.

But, many of these starts have not been capitalised upon. A healthy, literate population would have attracted businesses and employment.

Despite the state having many natural advantages — such as a geography like Manhattan or California that allows for the most populace to be connected by a single line [road and rail] — the state has not led the nation in its logistics, industry or economic activity.

Its cities that once traded actively with the world are not in the world’s trade map. Unlike the capitals of other southern states, Kerala’s capital and other cities are not a magnet for educated labour or returning NRIs. There are not many higher education institutions of repute.

Its people had to look to other state for jobs. The labour that often heads in is from poorer regions and attracted by higher minimum wages set by the law. Many in the state seem to be overemphasizing things like HDI and basic literacy — which while might look great in an Indian context — is a bare minimum thing anywhere else in the world.

The state is like Sri Lanka - similar geography - and has lower income, HDI, cleanliness and other indicators compared to Sri Lanka. And Sri Lanka is quite poor too. If it is poorer than Sri Lanka and lags behind the civil war torn nation in every indicator, it is not something to be proud of.

All the state pride people swallow up your pride and accept the truth. My state is poor and your state is poor. There is no reason to get our egos up on the issue of economy. As a country we are poor and every state is poor. And we are slowly getting out of that condition. Let’s build it and make it rich.

"The difference between India and England in the first test was hardly 30 runs. It was extremely close and a wicket on either side would have changed the result other way around. England plays well in their home and India have performed a lot poorer than this in the past.

The batting was poor, but the problem is that talent pool available in test batting and slip catching is probably the worst ever. While Indian top order was always poor overseas, I have never seen a middle order this poor in tests. It is hard to believe that just a decade ago, we had Sachin, Dravid, Ganguly and Laxman in the middle. In 70s, 80s, 90s also we had a very strong middle order.

Even if we sack the entire middle, there is nothing on the pot available.

The silver lining is that our bowling is probably in its best ever and can take the world’s best batsman in England or South Africa out, even without its two ace bowlers. I have never seen an Indian side where 5 fast bowlers can bowl in tandem and outpace & outswing the top sides. The days of just one Srinath, Zaheer or Kapil carrying the entire pace bowling is well past us."
"I have been to Ujjain a couple of times. To be honest — I was a bit underwhelmed by the city. Since I had read the city in history a lot of times, I expected more ancient history. I expected it to be grand.

This was a legendary city. This was a city where Krishna studied. This was the city of the great Mahakaleswar. This was the city of the great Vikramaditya. Kalidasa sang great things about this city of Avanti.

But, when I visited this in the 21st century it was a sad reflection of how India herself had fallen. I didn’t get to see a single thing from ancient history — as a series of invasions had wiped most of the ancient era. Rather it was a chaotic town with limited infrastructure. The temples were rather small and the pandits didn’t seem as well learned.

Whenever I visit such historic towns in the north, I’m more saddened. While the south is also dirty and chaotic, at least the ancient history got protected by the Vindhyas. But, in the north our history, traditions, culture and practices are more destroyed."
"The Indus Valley Civilization was found by a chance discovery during a railway laying project. The engineers found the locals carrying well made bricks and wanted to find the source — leading to unearthing of a great civilization.

As they kept on digging archaeologists kept on finding the civilization getting bigger and bigger. Four years ago, the largest city of the Indus Valley civilization was found in Haryana — Rakhigarhi, the biggest Harappan site.

Two months ago they found large chariots in Uttar Pradesh — In Uttar Pradesh, 4,000-Year-Old Chariots And Coffins Found.

In parallel, the ASI had been finding ancient sites of Indraprashta and Hastinapur - The discovery of Indraprastha. As they kept digging they have started to increasingly find evidence for the various events in Mahabharata — Experts dig up 950BC as epic war date.

Still, this a small fraction of what is to be found. Just as the Indus Valley Civilization lay for 4000 years underground keeping its secret, we are finding the Ganga hiding a few secrets near her. If we put more effort and investment in archaeology we might find the answers to many questions soon.

In short, the premise that the civilization was not found near Ganga is false. Archaeologists are unearthing bronze age era artifacts near the Ganga.

Indeed, we are increasingly finding out that it is not a mere Indus Valley Civilization, but more of Indo-Gangetic civilization or the Indian civilization.

The difference between corruption in developed countries and those in developing countries is that the former is organised, done at the top and made with the full approval of the legal system. They have lobbies, Luxembourg shell companies, Cayman bank accounts and a fairly complex system to hoodwink the tax authorities in a legal way.

In the developing countries, businessmen are less educated, use crude tactics and lower levels of government — employees not as well paid, and rely on bribes — lead the show.

"Understanding history is key to leadership. Whether they are military Generals or CEOs or Presidents, great leaders take a key interest in history. So do many who aspire for those leadership positions.

Leadership at the top is often a lonely affair. Many leaders often have a connect with leaders of the past and take inspiration and specific advice from the long dead ones. History is like having access to 100s of mentors around you.
History can often be used as an ice breaker and can help you network better. For instance, I was at a social gathering hosted at the home of the former President of our university. As I knew little of America’s pop culture or sports at that point, the primary focal point of the conversations was history. And I could network with dozens of strangers.
Knowing the background of things in general increases your comfort level in making decisions. It enlarges your perspectives.
Learning history is addictive. Almost every leader wants to leave a mark in history. To be able to leave a mark, you need to understand others who have left a mark and this is quite fascinating."
"When we talk of ancient India, we talk of great north Indian cities such as Mathura, Pataliputra, Gaya, Ayodha/Oudh/Awadh, Ujjain, Kashi, Delhi, Agra etc.

During the British Raj there were no real cities that were built in the north. The three cities that had all the power were Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. Here is India of 1893. Look at the 3 colours.


(Click to zoom)

Britain was mainly naval based and thus built its strength in the coasts than the interior. By the time the British built a city in the north — New Delhi — they were already on the way out.

Imagine 75% of India without access to major cities. The existing cities decayed for centuries, population moved out of the cities to villages and north India got paralysed for centuries. Even today, many north Indians have to move to Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and other cities for good jobs.

UP has a bigger population than Pakistan — even after Uttarakhand going out — and it has ZERO metropolis. ZERO major airports. Lucknow is getting there, but still decades away from competing with Delhi — and that is the only one city in a state with bigger population than Russia, Canada put together.

And again, this is one reason by the people from Mumbai, Chennai or Kolkata don’t hate British Raj as much as the guys from the north. We were simply not as impacted as the north.

Any many critics of the Raj talk about losing gold, silver etc. That is silly. You can always buy gold and silver. What the north India lost was far more precious — its cities, its economy and its livelihood.

This is not unfixable. North India has to build great many new cities for its 700 million people. Not ungodly unplanned mess of Gurgaon, satellite cities like Noida or small wonders like Chandigarh*. I’m talking about something grand like New Delhi, Bombay or Bangalore.

In the south, we have a great metropolis every state. In the north, there is a single metropolis for like 15 states. No wonder Delhi is crushed under the weight.

For UP and Bihar to rise up, build cities like crazy. Even if you can build a small one like Naya Raipur it is fine. But, shoot for New Delhi and bigger. Shoot for our generation’s equivalent of Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Pataliputra, Kashi and Agra.

— with all due respect to the future commentors who might be posting how planned Chandigarh is — it is not a metropolis by any stretch. It cannot even equal Lahore, leave alone Bombay or Delhi."
"India’s top 4 freedom fighters — Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Bose were all educated in the UK. Of these 4, Patel spent only 2.5 years abroad and thus he was the most grounded in Indian reality.

Other three spent a more extensive stint abroad impacting their worldy outlook. Bose was more impacted by European nationalism and took to European means to fight the British — raising a rebel army with the help of Germans. Nehru was more impacted by European socialists and developed a secular, liberal socialist, bourgeoisie outlook. Gandhi was not as well integrated/comfortable in England but he developed apprecatiation for various aspects of the Empire and religion.

While the top leaders coordinated, a lot of the work came from the Tier-2 leaders such as Rajaji, Rajendra Prasad who studied in India and were quite influential in conveying the ground realities to the top brass."
"This news is a much ado about nothing. I have been a reader of the CIA factbook since my college days and this characterization is nothing new or alarming.

I will copy the specific section from: Central Intelligence Agency


RSS is termed as a nationalist organization and I don’t think RSS would dispute that. Since when is being termed nationalist considered a bad thing? Have we come to that point?

VHP and Bajrang Dal are termed militant religious organizations. Militant group means those that are not averse to using forceful methods to achieve a political/religious objective. I don’t think VHP or Bajrang Dal would be averse to that characterisation. This is not the same as being called a terrorist group. If an organization is deemed terrorist, the factbook would call it out as it is."
"There are two different things here. One is to become a board member. Another is to control board seats and have your favorite guys be sat on it.

To become a board member at a top company, you have to be a well known executive. It is kind of a job. You can start from here: How to Get on a Corporate Board

However, you don’t have to become a board member. You can just control the seat like a puppet master. That’s what famous Wall Street raiders like Carl Icahn do. They take up equity positives much smaller than 20% and then push around to get plum board seats. For instance, he got 3 board seats at Blockbuster and was eventually able to lead to it to the ground: From Raider to Activist, but Still Icahn.

Getting board seats is more like getting seats in a Parliament/Congress. You have to put your money and then do a lot of campaigning to get others see you as the savior. You have to find out which board seats are coming up for a proxy election and then canvass hard. This process is called a Proxy fight - Wikipedia.

You have to understand how public markets work. Most of the investors in the public market don’t care about governance. That’s too boring or time consuming. They are sheep looking for someone to lead. Majority of the ownership in large companies are held by funds — mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign funds, university endowments etc. Most of these funds don’t have the capability to direct the companies they invest in and look for right kind of board members who can give direction.

Now, if you can convince these big funds that you have the capability to give the right direction to the company and use all kinds of power exchange mechanisms, they will often cede control to you.

You can start with this book/movie: Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. Then get to the nitty gritties on how to control a company. It is going to be hard and is going to look more like politics than economics.

"Revolution has a certain allure. You look around and see so many problems. You don’t have the time to change it one by one. You feel you can remove it all in one go. Since we don’t really understand the root of those problems when we are young, it seems quite possible that you can change it all overnight.

In all those euphoria you don’t look closely into the methods that brought Lenin or Mao into power. Or those used by people like Stalin. Hey, revolution requires a few sacrifices you say. Especially those who don’t comply. Like a love story in a movie, you focus on the “romance” that leads to the wedding and not the thing that comes after you get successfully married.

Communism seems to fight the Man — of those in power, of those controlling religions, of those who are rich — and these are appealing especially in the youth time when you feel powerless, feel impeded by religion and feel poor.

Many people go through that stage. For a long time I used to have Che Guevara flag as my desktop and used to read the works of Marx and Lenin. I spent a lot of time understanding Mao and Ho Chi Minh through books.


Then there comes a point, when you are not fighting the Man - but you are the Man. You are no longer as poor or as powerless. You are no longer impeded by religion, but feel empowered by it. You no longer feel the need to uproot the system, but actually have the power to change from within.

You see a devil far worser than authoritarianism — that is anarchy. Once you understand the perils of anarchy and how hard it is to bring things back into control, your love for revolution goes away.

That’s the time most grow out of communism.

Mahatma Gandhi would not have approved of a large memorial for him. He would have rather had Indians follow his ideals than his idols. I was also quite saddened to see the state of the Sabarmati ashram — while religious ashrams are mushrooming and roaring with good business, Gandhiji’s look dead — with no real socio political activities going on.

We cannot turn the national capital into a large scale masoleum. Over the next 1000 years we will have 100+ leaders and we cannot have sprawling estates to celebrate their deadness.

Delhi is setting a wrong example for other cities. In Chennai, we have converted our beach into a palace of the dead dravidian leaders. In UP, Mayawati was going around building white elephants — quite literally. We cannot afford Delhi to give the wrong direction.

The government has to consolidate all the varied Delhi memorials and have one great memorial to freedom — maybe Raj Ghat itself can be modified with that. And turn rest of them into schools and hospitals. While teen murti bhavan and other buildings can remain as memorials, you have to utilize the large area around them for more productive nation building activities."
"The premise of the question is invalid. None of the 4 earliest civilizations are white. A lot of the core ideas in mathematics, physics, chemistry and technology come from these regions.


Across the world, we use everyday a number of key ideas and innovations from places around the world — from Iraq, Egypt to India, China, Rome, Greece, Israel, Peru etc.

From potatoes of Peru to the arithmetic of India, from the paper of China to the governance structures of Rome, from the religious ideas of Israel to the wheel of central asia — our modern world is built on top of great ideas from civilizations around the world. Civilized world as we know stands on the shoulders of the giants."
"The premise of the question is somewhat disputed. You can see Indians if you walk into any hospital, motel, university, investment bank or a tech company. Unlike the Asians, Indians have also had much better political success [such as having two state Governors]. Americans also tend to understand Indian religions better than Asian religions.

That said, they might not be as visible as Asian Americans because:

Asia is a much larger continent than India. What you see in former are people from 30 odd countries — more numerous and more diverse.
India never fought a war with the US. A lot of the Asian immigrants — Vietnamese, Koreans, Japanese, Laotians, Cambodians — you see are from places US have warred and had to bring back people loyal to its military. These immigrants come from a variety of occupations. Indians predominantly come through the route of F1 student or H1B tech worker.
The poorly designed greencard system makes it super long for Indians to get a greencard, while it is quite easy for almost all other nationalities [excluding Chinese]. Until they have a greencard, immigrants are locked to a tech job. Once they get a greencard many Indians take up other professions — such as starting a restaurant.
Indian immigrants are more recent arrivals [since 1970s] while other Asians have been longer and thus have had multiple generations with deeper roots.
Given the difficulty in making a move from India through a outdated and unduly complicated visa process, a lot of immigrants tend to be upper caste/upper class, who carry their own professional biases. You are more likely to see them as a corporate executive than running a fruit stall.
Indian immigrants have been slightly better integrated in white neighborhoods and there are very few Indian ghettos. This makes them less visible as there are no equivalent of Chinatowns."
"Rajinikanth has little do with the development of the robotics field. The recent developments in robotics is due to the following improvements:

Computer Vision. Since 2012 Computer Vision has quite matured to do a lot of vision based intelligence including identifying people. Even in early 2018 face recognition APIs could only recognize a face in a predefined group of 1000. Now, that is multiplied 1000x.
NLP/conversational intelligence. Amazon, Google and others have been building strong developments in making conversation engines that have been matched by developments in open source conversations engines like the Rasa.
3d printing. Since 2010, 3d printing has become increasingly affordable to buy and robotics companies have been prototyping quick. Projects like Inmoov have utilized this and enabled people to build their robots quick.
Arduino. Until the arrival of Arudino about 10 years ago, programming embedded systems were hard even for engineers. Now, it is super easy for a 10 year old. This has made rapid prototyping even faster."
"India is able to have a common culture and ethnicity because of key geographical features. Look at the map below. There are massive mountains on India’s west, east and north, and ocean on the south. This has given it sufficient protection from the outside to build a unique culture.


Relative to the size of the mountains on its borders, the mountains inside the subcontinent are small. The only mountain that would slow a north-south assimilation is the Vindhya mountains. It is short in height and length allowing people to go around and through. Other than that it is just plains everywhere.

Again, you can see on the west there are gaps that connect it to Iran and Afghanistan. These provided the traditional cultural mix. But, they were more like windows than doors. Enough to bring some influence, but to prevent complete assimilation on both sides.

There are more commonalities between our states than differences. We worship same forms of God, celebrate same festivals, follow similar names, talk with similar vocabularies. We are one interface with different implementations."
"Let’s say you love football a lot. You would pick a side to support for this World Cup. If you don’t pick a side, for the most part you don’t care about the game.

Supporting earth is meaningless. That is like saying I support FIFA. Supporting earth against what? If there were a threat from the Martians or beings from other Galaxies, yeah. But, at this point there is none.

When you support your country, you are contrasting the cultural values against another country. You want to protect a particular way of life.

Across the world, we might be the same species but we speak different languages, follow different faiths, have different tastes and in general conduct different ways of life. When I express love for my country, I’m expressing my desire to protect my way of life. And do anything needed to defend that way of life from getting dead.

Again, I could say I support earth in the context of saving from environmental destruction, cleaning up plastic waste etc.

Everytime you say you support X, it has to have the counterpart against Y. If you don’t have the Y parameter, it is meaningless to support and as interesting as playing a game with yourself."
"n 1980s, when our dads and uncles would pick up their paper there would be headlines like ULFA gunning down dozens of people or Khalistan terrorists bombing a train or an airplane, LTTE ransacking a nation, a Prime Minister getting assassinated, Golden temple becoming a battle ground, Bhopal ending up in toxic gases, Delhi having a pogrom for Sikhs etc.

Compared to the present, the 1980s were a brutal, brutal time for India. Single rape or murder stories would not get reported as the newspapers had much bigger crimes and horror to report.

In terms of economy, it would take nearly 5 years of wait to get a telephone line. The TV would play only one channel — the sarkari one. To buy a Bajaj scooter you would wait 1–3 years. Foreign travel was unimaginable for the non-diplomats as RBI would not give you dollars. For everything you either have to wait for the government or not have it at all. Private sector was quite diminished.

Jobs were extremely limited and you were considered lucky to have a job. The movies of that time had an angry young man who didn’t get a job and then became a Robin Hood sort of.

In the mid 1980s we had the Ramayan frenzy — the serial became the most watched TV program in the world. Once upon a time, Ramayan attracted more viewers than Game of Thrones as hundreds of millions would find a TV somewhere in their neighbourhood on Sunday mornings. That was the light in a period of darkness.

Unlike other TV shows, the Ramayan series had a direct political implication. BJP used it to have rath yatras and got Rajiv Gandhi to open the gates of Ram Janmabhoomi/Babri Masjid."
"IBC: Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

Let’s say you got a lot of loan and are unable to repay. Logically, the bank and other people who gave you the money will take everything you own.

This didn’t happen as easily for companies. In India, companies which borrowed large loans and could not pay were not easily dissolved but became subject of never ending lawsuits. They fought on who should get paid first and how should the properties be sold, and by whom. Because of these never ending legal cases, the people who gave the loan [such as the banks] made large losses and this prevented them from giving loan to other businesses.

The IBC makes it easy and fast to dissolve a company that is no longer running. Courts appoint special teams that manage the dissolution and pay the creditors in a priority order.

This allows savings of tens of thousands of crores for the banks. SBI expects ₹ 30,000 cr recovery from resolution under IBC. This is just for one bank alone. And that is why this law is considered a big game changer.

Not all struggling companies need to be dissolved [meaning sold as pieces with their building, furniture and other things sold separate]. In fact, if you can protect companies while they are falling, the outcome would be best for everyone. That is the second provision of the IBC.

When a company is struggling and find it hard to pay monthly EMI it can file with the court and ask for protection. The court can help restructure its debt to ensure the company runs for a certain time. By that time either the company gets back on track or gets bought out. Both of these are better outcomes for the creditors than to see the whole company broken apart in pieces.

For this to happen, the court would mandate certain “haircuts” to make each creditor give up a part of their rights to ensure the company’s survival or sale. For instance, Bhushan steel was recently bought by the Tatas. It resulted in SBI recovering 70% of its loan [earlier they would fight for 100% and never get anything]. Leg up for IBC as Tatas buy Bhushan Steel

The IBC is a key element to make India both a business friendly country and have a system that is fair both to businesses and the society in general [in the previous system the people who borrowed could dodge the law for a long time]. Bad Is Turning Good- From SICA To IBC-The Journey Of Bad Loans In India

Now, the IBC is also expanded to include real estate — to make sure struggling real estate projects either are brought to life or sold to other companies — providing some return to the people who originally invested.

RERA is to bring fairness to real estate purchases. In the previous system the developers held all the cards. If you paid for a flat and it never got built or delivered on time, you are out of luck. The first provision of RERA is to have a government body regulating it, just as stock markets are regulated by the SEBI.

The RERA has provisions to make the property developers tell you the exact carpet area, make clear who owns the title, develop a standard sale agreement and most importantly make sure the money you gave them is locked in a proper account that is primarily used for construction.

The RERA is yet to provide sufficient benefits and is a work in progress. The state governments who are often influenced by real estate tycoons have been watering down the law and have been dodging the implementation. RERA: Implementation falls short of expectations | ORF

A lot more work to be done in this case."

"All the 3 constitutions have key articles that ensure fundamental rights. Japan provides the most fundamental rights — by including academic freedom, worker rights and marital rights in its Constitution.

All the 3 constitutions have a bicameral legislature. The upper house in all the 3 countries have a 6 year term and is never dissolved. India and US elect a third of the body every 2 years, while Japan elects a half every 3 years. In Japan and US the upper house is directly elected, while in India it is indirectly elected by the elected legislators of each state.

The lower house in all the 3 control key aspects such as the finance. In India, the lower house has 5 years, Japan has 4 years and US has only 2 years.

US follows a federal system (states are a fundamental unit), Japan follows a unitary system, while India falls in the middle (quasi federal).

India and Japan both follow the Parliamentary system — where the Prime Minister elected by the lower house of the legislature has the key power. US follows the Presidential system where the leader is directly elected by the people.

Indian Constitution is extremely detailed [among the longest in the world], US is quite simple, Japan’s is somewhere in the middle.

US and India don’t have an Emperor/monarch. Japan follows a Constitutional Monarchy like UK. One key difference being only males can head the monarchy — there is no provision for a female Emperor.

"Microsoft can also steal from your Word documents, Excel sheets, Visual Studio IDEs, Azure VMs etc. But, they don’t and wouldn’t.

I remember my first day at Microsoft when my dev manager told me one cardinal rule to writing code at Microsoft: “never ever look up any open source or third party code available on the Internet”. Not even for fun. You never know which one you would subconsciously copy.

If you think Microsoft would parse through massive mountains of your code, magically pick up fragments and integrate with their mountains of code at the risk of bankrupting the entire company with massive lawsuits, you are mistaken. It doesn’t happen that way.

Microsoft could do a lot of crazy things with Github [even to the extent of closing it down], but one thing you don’t have to fear is them stealing your code just because of their Github purchase."
"As I mentioned in earlier answer, the answer to who will be be remembered depends on who will be in power.

Chanakya is remembered in India. But, is he remembered in Pakistan [although he taught in Takshashila that is in Pakistan now]? Because, in Pakistan the powers to be have tried to take off all ancient influence, while in India the other way around.

Shakespeare is remembered as English is the most powerful language. What if no one speaks English in 4000 AD. Would Shakespeare be an influential figure still?

History has 1000s of great characters. Each of us think about only a handful — either the ones who had been great to our culture or those who had been terrible to ours. The others are forgotten. In medieval India, nobody knew Genghis Khan as he was not important to our culture.

Again, Jesus will be remembered if Christianity continues to be an important religion. But, if it goes the way of Zoroastrianism or other religions, its founder might not be considered as relevant.

History books would include everyone. You can personally pick up any obscure character and celebrate them. The question is who would be popular for public. That depends on who is pulling the public.

I don’t know who will be in power 2000 years from now. Thus, it is impossible to predict who will be remembered."
"In Hinduism there is the idea that there are different paths to an end destination. While my culture respects cows others might not. I’m mostly ok with it.

Honestly, I get uncomfortable with the smell of the lot of the meats, but I have learnt to tolerate them just as I learned to tolerate the smell of alcohol or even smoke. Possibly the other person might have also learned to tolerate the various unfamiliar smells of Indian masalas.

When I’m in a table having lunch/dinner with someone who is having T-bones, filets, tenderloins etc, I try to not think about the food and put my mind on the topic of the discussion.

"Disney is an asset heavy truck. Netflix is a sleek supercar.

Supercars are often priced over trucks despite having far less room inside.

Although Disney has a far bigger book and far more revenues:

Its business model is not easily scalable. Netflix went to 180 countries at the push of a button. Disney cannot scale its theme parks and production facilities to so many countries.
Disney has 100s of businesses that makes it inefficient in terms of executive time allocation. Netflix has one business and its executive time and energy is undivided.
When a company has a lot of businesses, the tigers will get compensated by the dogs. This reduces the net margins.
Netflix controls the key access to entertainment. Disney is primarily a content creator and doesn’t control the end user in most countries. This allows Netflix to have a monopoly just like Google, Amazon.
Netflix is treated as a tech company. If the movie business fails in some way, it could pivot to newer opportunities. Disney cannot be turned that easily."
"On the contrary, it was BJP that brought Dr Abdul Kalam to Rashtrapati Bhavan. When they lost power, so did the future of Kalam. The eminent man hoped for a second term in 2007, but the ruling Congress party would not accept him. They found a “better” candidate to replace our rocket man as the next President.

BJP has a sizeable base of nationalists and for many/most in the BJP India would be more important than even Hinduism — because if India dies so would Hinduism. Kalam did great many things for India and thus BJP celebrated him.

Hindu nationalism is not about having a particular god or a particular book, a particular religious law, a particular prophet etc. It is about making sure all existing faiths survive and thrive. Kalam followed his religion without disturbing others and was open to other ideas. This made him a perfect hero for the Hindu nationalists.

Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone?"
"Indian usage of large numbers preceded the western usage (History of large numbers). Ancient Indians had a strange fascination for large numbers. For instance, there was a number that appears in Bodhisatva texts: [math]10^{37218383881977644441306597687849648128}[/math]

Here is a chart of how Indians counted time — both with very large ones and very small ones.


Even in common usage the lakh ([math]10^5[/math]) and crore ([math]10^7[/math]) was very common in a land with a lot of people and a lot of gods. They made a more practical sense to count in multiples of 100. [Think of which is easy to say — Hundred Thousand or Lakh].

When the Hindu numeral system came to Europe around the 10th century, they didn’t have a term for number greater than 1000. It was not a practical necessity. While the Greeks, like the Indians, had some fascination to large numbers, the Romans didn’t see those as necessary.

By the 13th century, it became more necessary to talk about large numbers and the word million was introduced by the French, which was based on the word for thousands mille. A couple of more centuries later the billion was introduced. They multiplied in thousands and didn’t find it necessary to introduce intermediate terms.

In the recent centuries as we started adding commas and separators to make large numbers readable, Indians continued with the old way while the Europeans (and others) took the new way to count — in multiples of thousand.

Even those Indians who are exposed to the western methods find it convenient to use the Indian method — not just because ours is the older standard, but because it is practical. Counting in thousands leave a large gap inbetween that counting in hundreds fixes.

It is easier to say your salary is 2 lakh than 2 hundred thousand. Or say you bought a house for 2 crore than to say 20 million. However, when we write for a global audience we can seamlessly switch to the European standard."
"Dialogflow and Luis are both great tools to get you quickly started in building chatbots. We have used both of them and especially use Dialogflow for a lot of the conversations. It is quite easy and you can build a basic chatbot in 1 hour. To build more advanced ones with context takes more time, but still not hard.

However, there comes a point where you need far more control and be able to extend the underlying NLP models. We are right now moving to Rasa for that.

We see the following advantages in moving to Rasa:

Reducing dependency on 3rd party services. Some companies are notorious in cutting out or deprecating services, require additional payment, change SLA etc. Especially free services come with no real guarantee and the companies operate with the mantra that “you get what you pay”. If the chatbot is critical to your company, you might want to cut down the dependency.
Controlling the data. This is a game of data and you might not want to leave a critical business data going to a third party server.
Ability to deploy on-prem. Some customers are still leery of the cloud.
Ability to extend the model. We are building a range of conversational intelligence and depending on an open source stack is much better than a proprietary one.

"In 1984, Rajiv Gandhi invited Sam Pitroda - an acclaimed technologist to help India modernise telecommunication. He worked wonders assisting the government through new projects and policies. Researcher M. S. Swaminathan helped India into green revolution. Another researcher Verghese Kurien brought the white revolution. Scientist Homi J. Bhabha helped India with the nuclear revolution. None of these got through leading a government body the traditional ICS/IAS way.

While civil servants can help run bureaucracy and implement policies, you need experts from outside to build key policies.

Who would know how to bring about a better telecom policy:

Option A: A Phd in telecom engineering with 20 years experience running telecom companies.

Option B: A BA in History with years of experience as a district magistrate.

Most countries, including Singapore, hire experts from the industry and help them drive the policies. That leads to better professionalism. India relies way too much on career civil servants, who are no doubt smart, but might lack critical technology experience to drive the nation’s technology progress.

While it is awesome that India gives its young graduates power to run district administration, we are at a point where we need better experience and technology experience.

Nehru and Indira took smart decisions by bringing critical experts. There is no reason why Modi should not do the same.

Finally, speaking of fairness, if it is ok that someone who just cleared an exam [albeit a tough one] to immediately command over people who spent years working in their field [say the District SP vs a sub inspector], why can’t we have someone with real expertise take some of the critical posts which can change the future of the country?"
"Every good person will have some evil qualities. Every bad person will have some good qualities. It requires human judgment to weigh both of them and understand if a person should be considered good or not.

In fact, this is the whole role of the Itihasas - the great Indian epics. To help you perform the right judgment and use the right yardstick.

Just as Hitler had a few good qualities [he didn’t harm animals, he reduced smoking in Germany], Ravana had a few good qualities. However, in total they were both bad characters.

Ravana’s key problem was his arrogance. In fact, epics around the world differentiate heroes from villains with this simple quality. Hero and villains in most epics have similar skills, but differ in their humility. Mahabharata has so many sub stories of humility of the Pandavas compared with the arrogance of the Kauravas. Dhuryodhana and Karna were arrogant with the elders in many episodes, thus meeting an unfortunate end.

Vali and Ravana were similarly arrogant in Ramayana. They were both driven by anger and all the Rajasic guna, rather than by satvik guna. Even though Vali had the right skills and strengths, Rama and Hanuman both chose Sugriva’s side than Vali’s when they both had the choice [in different times]. Sugriva had the humility, Vali didn’t.

Here is a quick summary of Ravana:

The guy usurped the kingdom from Kubera, his elder brother. In contrast, Rama was completely untouched by power.
Ravana was so arrogant that his own wise brother [Vibhisana] abandoned him. In contrast, Rama had such a quality that his brothers treated him as divine. Bharata ran the kingdom with Ram’s sandals.
Ravana tried to extract vengeance for Lakshmana’s actions, by kidnapping a poor woman. Rama was untouched by the emotions of vengeance. He treated Ravana’s family well, like he did with everyone. He restored Lanka to its glory after the war.
Ravana had no real friends. Rama developed amazing friendships wherever he went. Even strangers who met Rama - such as Guha and Hanuman, were willing to give their life for Rama. It is those friendships that set Rama apart and brought him the victory.
Rama was humble and never touched by his own amazing skills. Ravana constantly boasted about his.
Rama was prone to love - for his wife, father, brothers, friends. He is supremely skilled in warfare that he was able to lead a ragtag army of Vanaras right into Lanka and win Ravana in his own ground. Despite all those mighty skills, Rama always stays humble and normal. Ravana was prone to anger, arrogance, power hunger, vengeance.

Now, exercise your own judgment on who is the greater of the two.Also see:

"As others mentioned one part is the cost of living. Some places are cheaper to live in than others. Thus, even in India you might get more salary in a bigger city than in a smaller city.

But, bigger issue is the one of economic barriers.

In an ideal world, labour and products would move around easily bringing out constant wage everywhere for the same labour.

In fact, in Europe it is somewhat true. Wages across UK, France, Germany and other western European countries are very close as there are no economic barriers. Even when the Liras, Marks, Pounds and Francs had widely different exchange rates.

However, between the developing world and the developed world there are huge barriers. These are through import duties and visas.

In professions where there is global mobility - say software development - there is a more convergence of wages. The work could be easily moved and so are the people.

However, in professions with limited global mobility - say truck driving or snow plowing or plumbing — there is a huge difference between a developing country wage and a developed world wage.

These barriers are slowly melting away with globalisation. In the past 20 years wages in India have grown by 10x or more, while in western countries it has remained mostly constant. This wage inflation in developing world would occur in parallel to the deflation in the developed world [despite their reserve banks pumping massive monies there is very low inflation]."
"Most countries throw stones while sitting in glass houses. Just as the US complains about abuses elsewhere, other countries can complain about abuses in the US — shootings of black people by police, mass incarceration of whole communities for relatively minor offences, large scale death sentences etc.

Not just locally, but elsewhere too. It is not like Kissinger was spreading roses around or Fallujah was drenched in kindness or that wedding parties in Afghanistan getting the gift of their dreams.

Any country you pick would have abuses hiding behind its closet. Rather than being hypocrites engage the other countries. Push their leadership to seek reason and reduce their abuses."
"It depends a lot on the job and the company.

Some of the things commonly looked at:

Fit. Will this person culturally fit into this organisation? Skillsets are a part of it, but a bigger thing is the attitude. Is this person’s overall character compatible with the rest of the organisation’s? Depending on the role/company these could include a range of things such as punctuality, dressing sense, work ethic etc.
Nice to work with. Is this person someone with whom the team would want to work with [or have beer with]. A terrible asshole with a great skill can still pull down the team. Your smile, posture and body language can all be important in many jobs.
Learnability. How fast this person can learn? Most organisations take in people who are relatively raw and then grow them inside. It is hard for an outsider to come ready with all the processes that the company needs.
Process oriented. In large companies, they also look for how good you are in understanding, following and implementing processes. At a smaller company the opposite of this — how good can you work in chaos, is appreciated.
I have interviewed and hired dozens of people and it is primarily attitude where I see key red flags. Attitudes are hard to change and can affect the team/company as a whole."
"Hindu nationalism is a result of a long period of political transformation that was a reaction to external invasions. Many Hindus truly believe that they are wronged in India and Hindu nationalists believe that they have to get Indians out of a perceived inferiority complex.

Vijayanagara Empire and Shivaji’s Maratha empire are among the key early elements of Hindu nationalism. In the modern day, Hindu nationalism draws inspiration from Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Savarkar, Netaji Bose and Aurobindo.

The Wiki article Hindu nationalism has surprisingly good coverage on this.

Overall I don’t see much wrong with Hindu nationalism as long as people understand the real Hinduism and India. Hinduism and India accepts ideas and people from all directions. Its essence lies in an intellectual curiosity. While we should defend those ideas, we should not make that defense an excuse for trampling other people’s faiths and ideas.

It is not the “secular” India that gave home to people of all faiths — early Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews — but the faith that believed on vasudeva kudumbakam. I don’t see any problem in restoring that ancient idea."

If an Indian cricket team cannot be led by someone who is not a specialist cricketer why do you think the Indian political system could be lead by someone who is not a specialist politician?

You cannot become a politician just by being a great economist or a great book author. Leading people is an art of its own.

The number of Quorans who are politically ignorant amazes me.

The one person who can take on Modi at this point is Sonia Gandhi. It was she who won against Vajpayee and led UPA to get a victory the second term. And she is old and sick now."
"RSS leaders have been mostly Brahmin for the same reason Congress leaders are mostly Brahmin.

Nehru had his upanayanam and most of his descendents followed Brahminical customs. Rahul Gandhi Is Janeu-Dhari Hindu, Says Congress


Jawaharlal Nehru during his upanayanam

CPI (M) was led by Brahmins too — Sitaram Yechury is a Brahmin and so is EMS Namboothripad. Other leaders such as Brinda Karat and Jyoti Basu are upper castes too.

Mamta Bannerjee is a Brahmin and so was Jayalalitha. Indian politics has often fought between “your brahmins vs our brahmins”.

Even the new age parties like the AAP are primarily dominated by Brahmin-Baniya group. Look at how many Sharmajis are in AAP’s legislature body. While Brahmins hold the most MLA seats the leader talks of baniya credentials. Kejriwal Calls Himself a 'Baniya', Woos Traders Ahead of Polls

RSS is not the only major organisation to be led by Brahmins. Neither the RSS leadership nor the other parties led by Brahmins deliberately designed the system this way.

People asked why this happens? I have a detailed post here: Leadership occurs in clusters by Balaji Viswanathan on Ode on a Grecian Urn

To this particular case on politics:

Brahmins are a minority and minorities are in general trusted with power. Think of the reason why we have historically recruited minorities like Sikhs, Kodavas, Gurkhas and Kumaonis for the army. The majority communities are sure that these minorities won’t get too much power as they don’t numerical strength — and thus often trusted with power.

In many places where there is a fight between two dominant communities, a middle “neutral” community is kept for the kingmarkers to play. For instance, Jayalalitha played a complex dance between the two main demographics of the ADMK - Thevars and Goundars. After she died, it became a mess with the Thevar faction (OPS/Sasikala) and Goundar faction (EPS) working together in a brokered deal.
